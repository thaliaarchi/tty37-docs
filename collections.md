# Teletype collections

Museums and collections with a Teletype Model 37 or other teleprinters.

- The [Interim Computer Museum](https://icm.museum/blog/?p=268) in Seattle has
  several teleprinters: Teletype models 28, 33, 35, and 37; DECwriter I, II, and
  III; and Siemens T100 (from email correspondence). The Model 37 and a BLIT
  video terminal are connected to the 3B2/1000-70. The Model 33s are used on the
  [PDP-7A from Boeing](https://icm.museum/blog/?p=352), which runs UNICS V0 with
  an emulated RM09 connected to the I/O bus, and the Altair 8800. The Model 28
  is connected to a current loop and runs a news feed at 45.5 baud. Many of the
  LCM machines ended up at the ICM [[1](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@icm/114870833408291217),

- The [Connections Museum Seattle](https://www.telcomhistory.org/ConnectionsSeattle.html)
  [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_Museum)] has a Teletype
  Model 37 ASR in their [collection](https://wiki.connections.museum/w/CMS:Teletype_Collection).
  A [2013 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MikoF6KZjm0) shows it connected
  to a System V Release 3.2.2 machine, which relayed chat messages to it and
  another 37 at the LCM, dialing with a Dataphone.

- The Living Computers Museum in Seattle had a Teletype Model 37 ASR in their
  [collection](https://web.archive.org/web/20161024131926/http://www.livingcomputermuseum.org/The-Collection/Exhibit-Hall.aspx).
  A [2018 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqgFK9h75eg) shows it connected
  to a System V Release 3.2.2 machine. It is not listed in the
  [August 2024 auction](https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/firsts-history-computing-paul-g-allen-collection/lots/3726).
  A [2016 photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/31336455571) by Erica
  Fischer appears to be of their Model 37.

- The [North American Data Communications Museum](https://nadcomm.com/) in San
  Diego has a Teletype Model 37 KSR (sans desk) and a typing unit for a Model
  37, as of [2003](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2003-February/001983.html).

- The [Antique Wireless Museum](https://www.antiquewireless.org/homepage/museum/)
  in Bloomfield, New York has a [Teletype exhibit](https://www.antiquewireless.org/homepage/vt-exhibit-22/)
  with many models, including an East German teleprinter with Latin and Cyrillic
  and a Model 28 Waterfall, as well as a [hands-on exhibit](https://www.antiquewireless.org/homepage/vt-exhibit-3/)
  with an operational Model 19. These exhibits are shown in a 2019 video tour at
  [12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkVz1BMLy0&t=751) and [1:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkVz1BMLy0&t=75),
  respectively. No Model 37 is shown.

- The National Museum of American History, part of the Smithsonian in D.C., has
  [a Teletype Model 37](https://www.si.edu/object/teletype-corporation-model-37-teletypewriter-printer:nmah_714260),
  but it is not on display.

- The [Tacoma Telephone Pioneer Museum](https://web.archive.org/web/20231022125518/http://www.scn.org/tech/telmuseum/)
  notes that it has teletype machines, but does not specifically list them. Its
  website has been offline since 2024. It appears to be related to the
  Connections Museum, as its site [originally](http://web.archive.org/web/19970626121039/http://www.scn.org/tech/telmuseum/)
  was for the Vintage Telephone Equipment Museum at the same Seattle location.

- [RTTY Electronics](https://www.johnwhitney.com/misc/paul-rtty.htm) in El
  Sobrante, California sells Teletype machines and parts, probably including the
  Model 37.

- [History for Hire](https://www.historyforhire.com/search/teletype) prop house
  in Hollywood has several Teletype machines, mostly Model 33s, but apparently
  no Model 37.
