Figure 1-37 ASR Teletypewriter Set

## 1. GENERAL

Figure 2 - Switched Network Application Using 37 Teletypewriter Equipment

1.01 This section provides a general description and operation of 37 Keyboard
Send-Receive (KSR) and 37 Automatic Send-Receive (ASR) Teletypewriter (TTY) Sets
which are used in switched network service (Figure 1).

1.02 A 37 ASR or KSR TTY Set is a heavy-duty terminal that functions with the
ASCII (American National Standard Code for Information Interchange) and has EIA
(Electronics Industries Association) Standard RS-232-B interfacing. The sets
operate at a speed of 150 words per minute (wpm).

1.03 The styling and equipment are designed to complement modern office
furnishings. The operator interface including keyboard layout and touch, quality
of printed copy and equipment noise is comparable to that of an office
typewriter. The equipment has a modular design which permits rapid conversion
from one type of set to another.

1.04 References to left or right, front or rear, top or bottom, etc, apply to
the set in its normal position as viewed by the operator.

1.05 The 37 KSR TTY Set originates data through its keyboard and the ASR TTY set
originates data through its keyboard or tape reader in the form of voltage
signals, ie, positive(+) voltage for spacing signals and negative (-) voltage
for marking signals. These voltages are converted into voice frequency tones by
a data set for transmission over communication lines. Received data, in the form
of voice frequency tones, is converted into voltage signals by a data set. The
voltage signals are used by the 37 KSR Set to copy the data on page size copy
paper or business forms and by the 37 ASR Set to copy the data on page size copy
paper or business forms and/or fully perforated tape.

1.06 Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating the use of 37 TTY equipment in a
switched network application. It should help in understanding the overall
capabilities of a 37 TTY set.

1.07 Data station A may call station B and transmit and/or receive data through
their common central office. Station A may exchange data with station C using
the switched network facilities between the two central offices.

1.08 A 37 TTY data station may be used to communicate with a customer-provided
time-shared computer D. In a switched network application, station A may call
the computer. When the computer answers the call, station A and the computer may
exchange data.

1.09 Conversely, each data station is equipped to receive calls from the
computer through the switched network system. This permits the computer to call
any of the data stations and transmit or request data.

1.10 References made to features, descriptions, or operations of the 37 TTY sets
are assumed to be common to both the KSR and the ASR sets unless stated
otherwise.

### KEYBOARD SEND-RECEIVE UNIT COMPONENTS

Figure 3 - 37 KSR Teletypewriter Set (Components)

#### A. Typing Unit

Figure 4 - Typing Unit

2.05 The typing unit (Figure 4) receives information serially by means of a
single magnet (two coils) type of selector. A function box is provided for
character and character sequence recognition.

2.06 Page copy is provided by the typing unit which prints both upper and lower
case characters utilizing a typebox positioned by an aggregate motion mechanism.
The typebox is moved from character to character and is returned to "home"
position when reception stops, thus, making all characters visible when the
machine is idle.

2.07 The typing unit is capable of printing symbols for all 128 ASCII
characters. Normally, however, it will be arranged to print the 94 graphic,
numeric, and alpha characters of ASCII.

2.08 Normally the typing unit will print ten characters per inch allowing 72
characters on an 8-1/2 inch platen with normal margins on the paper. Optionally,
other typing units may be arranged to print 12 characters per inch allowing 86
characters on an 8-1/2 inch platen with normal margins on the paper. Line feed
provides for spacing six lines of type per vertical inch.

2.09 Two types of paper feed options are available:

1. A typing unit arranged for friction feed is capable of accommodating roll
   paper widths of 3 to 8-1/2 inches and capable of providing multiple copies of
   one original and two carbons.

2. A typing unit arranged with sprocket feed is capable of handling sprocket
   feed paper 11 inches long and 9-1/2 inches wide. One-half inch is needed on
   each side of a page to allow for sprocket holes. The typing unit is capable
   of providing multiple copies consisting of one original and up to five
   carbons.

2.10 All typing units are equipped with line feed and carriage return (both
on-line and local), on-line backspace, and craftsman adjustable margins.

2.11 Optional paper positioning controls are provided for either friction feed
or sprocket feed typing units:

1. Form-Feed - When the typing unit detects the form-feed character, it will
   position the paper for printing on the first line of the next page. Pages up
   to 15 inches in length, adjustable by a craftsman, may be accommodated. The
   typing unit form feeds three lines during one character interval. Two
   successive form feeds are prevented unless there has been an intervening line
   feed.
2. Horizontal Tabulation - This feature is a fixed tabulator stop type. The
   fixed stops are set by a craftsman to customer specifications.
3. Vertical Tabulation - This feature is a fixed tabulator stop type. The fixed
   stops are set by a craftsman to customer specifications.
4. Horizontal Tabulation On-Line Control - This is an on-line feature used to
   set and clear tabulation stops in the typing unit horizontal tabulation
   mechanism. The characters ESC 1 are used to set tabulator stops and the
   characters ESC 2 are used to clear the stops.
5. Vertical Tabulation On-Line Control - This is an on-line feature used to set
   and clear the tabulation stops in the typing unit vertical tabulation
   mechanism. The characters ESC 5 are used to set the tabulator stops and the
   characters ESC 6 are used to clear the stops.

#### B. Keyboard

Figure 5 - Keyboard

<figure>
<img src="keyboard.png" alt="Figure 6 - Keyboard Arrangement">
<figcaption>Figure 6 - Keyboard Arrangement</figcaption>
</figure>

2.12 A standard 4-row keyboard (Figure 5) is used. The keytop arrangement is
consistent with a standard office typewriter (Figure 6).

2.13 The keyboard is an electromechanical device for generating ASCII
combinations. It converts the mechanical depression of a key into electrical
code patterns. Keys move codebars which control electrical contacts. The
electrical contacts present an even vertical parity parallel wire output to a
keyboard control logic card in the electrical service unit which converts the
signals into ASCII.

2.14 It is possible to generate all 128 code combinations of ASCII. Upper and
lower case alpha characters, numerics, and special graphic characters are
designated on the keytops. Control characters are designated on the keyboard in
two ways. The most often used controls appear on separate keys and are active in
both the shifted and unshifted modes without use of the CONTRL key. Another
group of controls appear on the same keytop with a graphic. To generate these
code combinations, it is necessary to depress the CONTRL key while the
particular key is struck. All control character designations requiring the
depression of the CONTRL key, as well as the individual key, appear on the
keyboard in charcoal grey.

2.16 A transmission disable feature is provided to prevent transmission from the
keyboard or reader. Transmission may be disabled and enabled under control of
on-line signals as covered in 4.10 and 4.30. This feature does not physically
lock the keys of the keyboard but inhibits output from the transmitter
distributor.

#### C. Base

2.17 The base provides mounting facilities for the typing unit, motor unit, and
intermediate gear assembly. Holes are also provided on the base for mounting the
keyboard reset mechanism and margin indicator switch.

#### D. Control Panel

<figure>
<img src="control_panel.png" alt="Figure 7 - Typical Control Panel Arrangements">
<figcaption>Figure 7 - Typical Control Panel Arrangements</figcaption>
</figure>

2.18 The control panel (Figure 7) which is located above the keyboard contains a
number of nonlocking pushbuttons. In addition, there are two mechanical
pushbuttons designated PAPER ADVANCE and LOCAL RETURN. The two different
arrangements available to meet varying applications are shown in Figure 7.
Functional descriptions of the different controls are given in Table A.

**Table A - CONTROLS DESCRIPTION**

| CONTROL (Figure 7)             | FUNCTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OFF LINE                       | Depressing this pushbutton lights the associated indicator and activates the teletypewriter for use in the off-line (local) mode. A second operation of the pushbutton extinguishes the light and conditions the equipment for incoming and outgoing calls. If this pushbutton is depressed while a data call is in progress, a disconnect will result.                                                           |
| PAPER ADVANCE                  | Paper is fed out of the typing unit for as long as this pushbutton is held depressed. This is a local function only, and has no effect on the distant station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| LOCAL RETURN                   | When this pushbutton is depressed, the typing unit carriage returns to the left margin. This is a local function only, and has no effect on the distant station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| INTRPT (interrupt)             | When momentarily depressed, this pushbutton causes a timed (380 to 750 millisecond) spacing signal (break) to be sent on-line. It is used by the receiving station to interrupt transmission from the sending station.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| PROCEED                        | This lamp lights when the station is ready for sending from the keyboard. (It will light when the unlighted pushbutton is depressed, or when an ACK character is received, and will turn off when a NAK character or interrupt signal is received.) Either the receipt of an ACK character or manual operation of the PROCEED pushbutton will relight the lamp. The lamp turns off when a data call is completed. |
| HERE IS                        | When momentarily depressed, this pushbutton starts the local answer-back mechanism which causes a stored series of characters (such as station identification) to be sent. The answer-back only operates on-line.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ALARM                          | When lighted, this lamp may indicate a low-paper supply condition. The ALARM lamp also optionally lights when a character is received with incorrect vertical parity. The lamp will be turned off by depressing the ALARM pushbutton if a parity error was received. When lighted by a low-paper condition, the lamp turns off only after the paper supply is replenished.                                        |
| EOL (Printer End of Line)      | This lamp lights to indicate the end of a printed line (adjustable for any length of line suitable to the typing unit). The light goes off when a new line is started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| READER AUTO                    | When this pushbutton is depressed, the associated lamp lights, and the station is conditioned for auto control of the reader by the characters DC1 and DC3. When the pushbutton is depressed again, the light goes out and the auto reader control feature is disabled (both the reader and typing unit must be on-line).                                                                                         |
| KBD LOCAL                      | When this pushbutton is depressed, the associated lamp lights, the typing unit motor starts, and the keyboard is placed in the off-line (local) mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| PRINTER LOCAL                  | When this pushbutton is depressed, the associated lamp lights, the typing unit motor starts, and the typing unit is placed in the off-line (local) mode. When the pushbutton is depressed again, the typing unit is placed in the on-line mode.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| READER LOCAL                   | When this pushbutton is depressed, the associated lamp lights, the reader motor is started, and the reader is placed in the off-line (local) mode. When the pushbutton is depressed again, the lamp goes out, the motor stops, and the reader is placed in the on-line mode.                                                                                                                                      |
| PUNCH LOCAL                    | When this pushbutton is depressed, the associated lamp lights and the reperforator (punch) is placed in the off-line (local) mode. The punch selector may be blinded or not depending on the state of the PUNCH ON pushbutton. Depressing the pushbutton again turns off the light and restores the reperforator to the idle condition.                                                                           |
| PUNCH ON                       | When this pushbutton is depressed, the associated lamp lights and the reperforator selector is unblinded. Depressing the pushbutton again turns the lamp off and causes the reperforator selector to be blinded. For local operation of the reperforator, the PUNCH ON pushbutton must be depressed after PUNCH LOCAL is depressed.                                                                               |
| KBD EOL (Keyboard End of Line) | This lamp is lighted by a character counter and indicates that sufficient characters have been perforated in tape to produce a line of characters on page copy. The counter counts down on backspace and is reset on carriage return.                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### E. Motor Unit

2.19 The function of the motor is to provide electromechanical rotating motion
for operating the typing unit and keyboard reset mechanism.

2.20 The motor is a synchronous-type, rated at 1/20 horsepower, and is operated
from a 117 volt ±10% ac, single phase, 60 hertz ±0.45 Hz source of commercial
power. It consists of a 2-pole wound stator with two windings (a main running
winding and a start winding), and a ball bearing rotor. The start winding is in
series with a start relay, capacitor, and thermal cutout switch which are
mounted in a compartment of the motor mounting cradle.

#### F. Typing Unit Cover and Pan

2.21 The typing unit cover and pan includes copylights and provides the housing
for the typing unit, keyboard and base, motor, and control panel. The cover and
pan with assembled components normally mount onto a table.

2.22 The cover is hinged to the pan and can be easily removed, or it may be
raised and extended over interior components while maintenance is being
performed.

2.23 Two lids at the top of the cover provide access to the typing unit for
ribbon changing, replenishing paper supply, adjusting print hammer for multiple
copy, etc.

#### G. Table

2.24 The table provides a mounting surface for the typing unit cover and pan and
the other components which the cover and pan houses. In addition, a compartment
of the table provides facilities for mounting the electrical service unit
including the utility strip. The ac power for the set components is obtained
from the utility strip when its ac power cord is plugged into a commercial
source of power.

2.25 Three optionally available tables may be obtained: A double-compartment
table and two single-compartment tables which differ primarily in overall depth
dimension (Figure 15).

#### H. Electrical Service Unit

2.26 The electrical service unit (Figure 8) consists of a chassis assembly and a
utility strip which mount into the lower part of the knee well of the table. The
chassis assembly has a multivoltage power supply, a wiring field, and is
equipped with eleven card connectors. A set of circuit cards selected for a
given arrangement provides the set logic (Table B). The cards mount into the
card connectors.

2.27 Wiring from the card connectors terminates at the wiring field which
provides a centralized wiring location for the set. Cable assemblies with
several plugs also terminate at the wiring field. The plugs connect to the
typing unit, keyboard and base, control panel, copylights, etc. An interface
connector provides a signal interchange point which conforms with the EIA-232-B
Standard.

2.28 A power cord from the chassis assembly plugs into one of the six ac power
receptacles of the utility strip. The ac power for the set is provided over a
single ac power cord which terminates at one of the two utility strip terminal
boards, and is controlled by a circuit breaker.

2.29 A bell assembly, copylight transformer, and motor control relay are also a
part of the utility strip and derive their power from the multivoltage power
supply in the chassis through a second utility strip terminal board.

2.30 The mutlivoltage power supply converts ac power into appropriate dc power
which is used for internal set operation, ie, the regulator, solenoids, lamp
driver amplifiers, motor control relay, bell, integrated and discrete
semiconductor circuits, etc.

#### I. Data and Attendant Set

2.31 The standard data set for 37 TTY DATA-PHONE service is Data Set 103H
(Figure 9). This data set is a general purpose, full-duplex, frequency shift
keyed, serial data transmission set that accepts voltage signals from the
teletypewriter logic, and converts these signals into voiCe frequency tones.
These tones are transmitted over the telephone transmission facilities to the
distant terminal, where a compatible data set converts the voice frequency tones
into voltage signals.

Figure 9 - Data Set 103H

2.32 The Data Auxiliary Set DAS804P-type (Figure 10) is available with the
following dialing features:

1. Rotary dial
2. "TOUCH-TONE®" dial
3. Rotary and card dialer
4. TOUCH-TONE and card dialer

Figure 10 - Attendant Set Controls (Rotary Dialer) (DAS 804P5)

Each type has associated with it a hand telephone set, a loudspeaker, amplifier,
loudspeaker control, ringer, and a set of combination pushbutton indicators
(Table C). The pushbutton indicators are used to control calls, or test the data
set.

### RT MODULE COMPONENTS

#### A. Reperforator Unit

2.33 The reperforator unit (Figure 11) is an electromechanical device that
converts data received serially into corresponding perforations in tape. It uses
a single magnet selector similar to that used in the typing unit (2.05).

Figure 11 - Reperforator Unit

2.34 The unit is a nontyping reperforator that provides fully-perforated tape.
It is equipped with a manual interfering tape feed-out mechanism to simplify
tape loading. The reperforator unit also includes a power backspace mechanism.
This device permits backspacing tape to eliminate erroneous data by overpunching
with delete characters. A typing reperforator is optionally available.

#### B. Reader Unit

2.35 The reader unit (Figure 12) is an electromechanical device used to convert
perforations in tape into corresponding parallel electrical data.

Figure 12 - Reader Unit

2.36 The reader is equipped with a manual control lever, tight-tape and tape-out
alarm sensors, and the reader step feature. The control lever has three
positions: RUN (operating position); STOP (off position); and FREE (tape
threading position).

#### C. Electrical Service Unit

2.37 The electrical service unit used in the RT module contains a wiring field
and circuit cards required to control the reperforator and the reader units
(Table B), interconnecting control and power cables, and a control panel.

| RUN             | position and turn-off in the STOP position. In the FREE position, the feed wheel is free and tape may be pulled through the unit without opening the tape lid. When the automatic reader start feature is activated, transmission may occur with the control lever in the RUN or STOP position, but not in the FREE position. |

#### D. Motor Units

2.39 The RT module includes two motor units. One is used to drive the
reperforator and is identical to the typing unit motor unit (2.19). The reader
unit is driven by a synchronous-type motor developing 1/50 hp and operating at a
speed of 1800 rpm.

#### E. RT Module Cabinet

2.40 The RT module cabinet provides mounting and operating facilities for the
reperforator unit, reader unit, electrical service unit, motor units and bases.
It includes a hinged cover with a clear window for access to the reperforator
unit and tape supply container. A chad disposal tube is provided for holding
punched chad.

2.41 A reader base is fastened to a mounting bracket in the cabinet with
vibration mounts. A toothed belt and pulley are used in conjunction with the
motor unit to drive the reader unit.

2.42 The cabinet includes a reperforator base and a mounting plate for
installing the reperforator unit and motor unit. A tape supply container with an
8-inch diameter supply reel, a low-tape alarm switch, and connecting cable are
included with the reperforator base.

2.43 The cabinet door encloses the electrical service unit compartment. The door
may be optionally equipped with either one power tape winder or a combination of
a winder and unwinder. A switch is provided on the door to control the tape
winders (Figure 14).

## 4. OPERATION

### GENERAL

4.01 The operation of the set is described in terms of the interface leads
controlling both the sending and receiving devices and the communications
channel (Figure 16).

4.02 As an example of a switched network application, the description of
establishing and terminating a call applies to a set operating with telephone
facilities.

Figure 16 - 37 TTY Set Peripheral and Channel Interface

### PERIPHERAL INTERFACE

4.03 The following four leads (Figure 16) are used by the TTY set logic to
prepare the set to receive data.

1. Receiver Selectable: This is an indication from the typing unit to set logic
   that the receiving device is selectable, ie, there is no condition, such as
   paper-out, which disqualifies it to receive a message. A receiver not
   selectable indication is an alarm condition which will allow a call already
   in progress to be completed and then prevent reception of another call.

2. Receive Message: This is a command from set logic to the receiving device to
   prepare for receiving a message. This would include, for example, starting
   the typing unit motor.

3. Receiver Ready: This is an indication by a selectable receiver, in response
   to Receive Message, that operations preliminary to receiving have been
   performed. For example, if the typing unit motor was started on receipt of
   Receive Message, Receiver Ready would be indicated after a timed interval
   during which time the motor reaches operating speed.

4. Receiver Serial Data: The serial data on this lead is at set logic voltage
   and current levels. Logic zero is a space and logic one is a mark.

4.04 The following 13 leads (Figure 16) are used by the TTY set logic to prepare
the set to transmit data:

1. Message Available: This is an indication by the transmitting device to the
   set logic that it has a message to send. Once the set logic has responded,
   this indication is binding on the set.

2. Send Message: This lead is used by set logic to acknowledge Message
   Available. It starts any preliminary operations required to prepare the
   transmitting device to transmit data.

3. Sender Ready: This lead is used by the transmitting device to acknowledge
   Send Message and to indicate that preliminary transmitting operations have
   been completed and that the device is ready to produce a character.

4. Present Character: This signal to the transmitting device acknowledges Sender
   Ready and directs the transmitter to place a character on the parallel signal
   buss.

5. Character Available: This signal to set logic acknowledges Present Character
   and indicates the transmitter is displaying a character on the parallel
   signal input to the set logic. The character must be sampled by the
   distributor within the operation of this lead by the transmitter.

6. Parallel Data: This is a set of eight leads on which characters are bussed in
   parallel from the transmitting device to the distributor for serialization.

### CHANNEL INTERFACE

4.05 The channel interface signals conform to EIA Standard RS-232-B and are
listed, along with the name, purpose, and pin number of each lead, in Table E.
The leads which have designations beginning with A are ground leads. Interface
leads which have designations beginning with B are data leads. Interface leads
which have designations beginning with C are control leads.

4.06 The data leads are positive (+) or high for spacing signals and negative
(-) or low for marking signals. A positive (high) voltage on a control lead
means it is on, and a negative (low) voltage means it is off.

### ORIGINATING AND ANSWERING

4.07 Data communication is started with the set in the idle condition - Request
to Send (CA lead) permanently on, copylights off, and motor not running. Data
Terminal Ready (CD lead) must be on, ie, an alarm condition must not exist and
at least one receiving device is in the on-line mode. Under these conditions a
data call can either be originated or answered.

4.08 While establishing a connection, the line interface unit at both the
originating and answering sets should turn on the Data Set Ready (CC lead),
remove the mark hold from Received Data (BB lead), turn on Clear to Send (CB
lead). After Clear to Send, the set enables the Transmitted Data (BA lead). In
addition, at the answering set, Ring Indicator (CE lead) is turned on after
ringing occurs.

4.09 Ring Indicator (CE lead) at the answering set conditions the answer-back
start logic circuitry so that when Clear to Send (CB lead) is turned on, a pulse
is generated which starts the answer-back cycle, if so equipped.

4.10 When Data Set Ready (CC lead) at a set is turned on", the motor starts, and
copylights go on. The PROCEED lamp located on the set control panel will light
whenever Clear to Send (CB lead) is on, and the PROCEED pushbutton is operated,
or after receipt of the ACK character in the presence of Clear to Send. The
lighted PROCEED lamp indicates that transmission from the keyboard is enabled,
and exchange of data can take place.

### LOCAL OPERATION

#### A. Device Selection

4.11 The particular transmitting or receiving device to be used in local
operation is selected by depressing the corresponding button on the control
panel (Tables A and D). The selected pushbutton lamp will light to indicate the
selection of local operation.

4.12 The reperforator unit has two controls: PUNCH LOCAL and PUNCH ON. For local
operation, PUNCH ON and PUNCH LOCAL must be lighted to enable the reperforator
to receive data.

#### B. Motor Control

4.13 The typing unit, reader unit, and reperforator unit motors are started by
selection of OFF LINE or PRINTER LOCAL, READER LOCAL, and PUNCH LOCAL
pushbuttons, respectively.

#### C. Message Exchange

4.14 The transmitting device selected presents Message Available to the send
control logic. If no other transmitting device in the local mode has been given
sending priority, the send control logic responds with a Send Message command.

4.15 When the transmitting device is properly conditioned, it initiates a Send
Ready signal. At this time, provided no tabbing is in process and the local
transmitting distributor is conditioned, the send control turns on the Present
Character lead.

4.16 The transmitting device responds with Character Available. This results in
serialization of the data in the local transmitter distributor.

4.17 The receiving devices which have been selected to operate in the local
mode, as determined by the control panel pushbuttons, copy the message sent from
that transmitting device which is also in the local mode. In the local mode the
set ignores the condition of the Receiver Selectable and Receiver Ready signals
and the receivers copy any data transmitted through the local distributor.

### LINE OPERATION

#### A. Device Selection

4.18 Transmitting and receiving devices to be placed on-line are selected by
depressing the corresponding pushbutton on the control panel. A nonlighted
pushbutton indication means line operation has been selected.

4.19 The typing unit must be selected for line operation if a call is to be
established. Optionally the reperforator may be selected as the line receiver.

4.20 The PUNCH ON lamp must be on to enable the reperforator unit.

4.21 The READER AUTO pushbutton (lighted when depressed) permits on-line control
of the reader unit by a remote station sending DC 1 (reader on) and DC 3 (reader
off).

4.22 Automatic on-line control of the reperforator is provided by a remote
station sending DC 2 (reperforator on) and DC 4 (reperforator off).

#### B. Channel Establishment

4.23 For stations equipped with telephone facilities, a call is placed and a
connection between two stations is established before any teletypewriter data is
transmitted. To answer the call, the called station must be in service and have
no alarm conditions.

4.24 The calling station dials the called station, which turns on Ring
Indicator. This primes the called station answer-back. Since the Data Terminal
Ready lead is normally on (no alarms present), Data Set Ready turns on. This
results in Clear to Send turning on and an indication that the connection is
established.

#### C. Message Exchange

4.25 With Clear to Send on, messages may be exchanged when the PROCEED lamp
lights. This is done automatically on receipt of the ACK character or manually
by depressing the PROCEED pushbutton on the control panel.

4.26 Data transmission can be stopped on receipt of an interrupt signal. The
PROCEED pushbutton must be depressed to reactivate the sending capability.

4.27 Data is exchanged between the transmitting and receiving sets at different
stations using the line distributor for serialization.

4.28 The data exchange is a half-duplex operation, ie, the transmitted data is
copied by the sending station. For sets so equipped, the on-line full-duplex
mode of operation may be used to permit simultaneous two-way message exchange.

### SIMULTANEOUS LOCAL-LINE OPERATION

4.29 The ASR set can be used in the local and line modes of operation
simultaneously. As an example, the reperforator unit and keyboard may be
switched to local and messages processed locally (keyboard to reperforator) and
on-line (reader and typing unit).

### CHANNEL TERMINATION

4.30 The PROCEED lamp will go out and the keyboard will be electrically disabled
(blinded) for further data transmission whenever either the on condition of
Clear to Send (CB lead) is lost, the NAK character is received, or the interrupt
signal is received. If Clear to Send (CB lead) is on, transmission from the
keyboard can be enabled again either manually by operating the PROCEED
pushbutton or automatically by receipt of the ACK character.

4.31 The set will disconnect and data transmission will be automatically stopped
upon receipt or transmission of the EOT character. The EOT signal causes Data
Terminal Ready (CD lead) to momentarily turn off. With Data Set Ready (CC lead)
on, the data set recognizes this condition as a request to disconnect and should
cause disconnect to take place.
