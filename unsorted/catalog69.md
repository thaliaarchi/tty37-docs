## introduction and catalog use

This catalog describes Teletype Model 37 equipment for transmitting data over
switched network services available through telephone and telegraph companies.
These terminals can be used for general data communications as well as for
computer input/output. The application of the Model 37 terminal to the switched
network requires a data set or data access arrangements provided by the common
carriers.

Each particular set (e.g., the Model 37/300 automatic send-receive set) is
available in five arrangements with options for each arrangement. These include
table variations, paper handling, and tape handling facilities.

A catalog number with each set arrangement in combination with each option
allows easy ordering of a complete terminal.

Catalog numbers for Model 37/300 automatic send-receive sets include a punch and
reader module. However, if, initially an application requires use of a keyboard
send-receive set (KSR) for conversion to an ASR in the future, the ASR set can
be ordered less the punch and reader module: For example:

- Catalog No. 37/302-1A ASR set complete.
- Catalog No. 37/302-1AX ASR set without the punch and reader module.
- The resulting catalog number, 37/300-1AX, is the KSR required as denoted by
  the “X” following the number.

## Brief Description

Terminals described in this catalog are normally utilized for point-to-point
data communications, or, as computer input/output terminals. Maximum data
transfer rate is 150 words per minute.

The family of terminals in this catalog includes the following terminal
configurations:

**Model 37/100 \
Receive-only sets (RO)**

These sets provide for receiving printed page copy only. They do not have
transmitting capabilities except when equipped with a station identification
generator (answer-back mechanism).

**Model 37/200 \
Keyboard send-receive sets (KSR)**

Model 37/200 terminals are keyboard-equipped for sending to other terminals or
computers. Outgoing data is typed on the page printer for visual checking. The
terminal can also be arranged for full-duplex operation which allows
simultaneous sending and receiving.

**Model 37/300 \
Automatic send-receive set (ASR)**

Model 37/300 terminals are a combination of an appropriate KSR set and a punch
and reader module.

This configuration is the complete terminal. It has the capabilities of the RO
and KSR sets in addition to providing off-line and on-line tape reading and
punching. Tape handling also can be included in the punch and reader module
cabinet for operator convenience. This gives you maximum data handling
capabilities from a single terminal.

## General Characteristics

**Speed and Signal:** Model 37 terminals operate at 150 words per minute (15
characters per second) at a 150 baud transmission rate. The sets utilize a
serial input/output 10 unit code signal consisting of a start bit, seven
information bits, an even parity bit, and a stop bit. Each bit is 6.67
milliseconds in duration.

**Code:** Model 37 handles the USAS X-3.4 ASCII Code and prints the 94 graphics
of this code with letters in both upper and lower case. Adding a Shift-Out
feature allows printing either 16 or 32 additional graphics.

**Printing:** The standard terminal uses a 6-row removable typebox with
provisions for 96 type pallet positions. When a Shift-Out feature is included,
the 6-row typebox is replaced with a 7-row typebox allowing 112 type pallet
positions, or it can be replaced with an 8-row typebox allowing 128 type pallet
positions.

*Page 4:*

**THIS IS A SAMPLE OF A MODEL 37 PRINTOUT.**

Model 37 prints standard numerals, symbols, and upper and lower case letters. In
<u>two-colors</u>, if desired.

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    1234567890!"#$%&'()<{ =_}~
    |\^]-[>@`+:*:,.?/

The following will demonstrate the use of reverse line space, half reverse line
space, line space, and half line space. With these features we may print
mathematical expressions:

(a + b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>

\[EXAMPLE]

These features also permit us to print chemical expressions:

O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O+4e=4OH

Utilizing half forward and reverse line space, graphs also can be readily
constructed.

\[EXAMPLE]

(reduced size)

Hydrocarbon molecular structures may also be constructed:

\[EXAMPLE]

(reduced size)

FLUOROMETHOLONE

Among the latest features to be made available in the Teletype Model 37 is
on-line tab setting for both vertical and horizontal tabulation.

Lets look first at Horizontal Tabulation:

1. We clear all tabs:
2. Set the tab-stops as required:
3. Transmit the message:

\[EXAMPLE]

(reduced size)

To change the format, we again clear and reset the tab-stops:

\[EXAMPLE]

(reduced size)

Vertical tab setting is accomplished using the above procedure except that
Form-Feed is required to locate the beginning of the form prior to vertical tab
clear.

Power Requirements:
- 115VAC ± 10%, 60 HZ ± .45 HZ
- RO: Approx. 200 Watts
- KSR: Approx. 300 Watts

**Interface:** Model 37 terminal interface**meets requirements of Electronics
Industries Association Standard RS-232-B. No coupling device is required between
the Model 37 terminal and any compatible data set or equivalent unit. This
simplifies installation and maintenance of the terminal.

\*See pages 15, 18, 21, and 24 for arrangements.

## Control Panel

\[Photo of control panel buttons]

**Control Panel**

Depending on the set configuration, the control panel can contain 6, 12, or 18
combination keys and/or lamps. The following is a description of each individual
key and lamp combination available for Model 37 terminals. However, to determine
the combination of key and/or lamps for a particular terminal, review the
appropriate terminal description chart in this catalog. (Note: The particular
key feature follows the actual key designation.)

**RECEIVE-ONLY TERMINALS (RO)**

**LOCAL RETURN - PAPER ADVANCE**

**Local Return and Paper Advance Keys.** These keys initiate mechanical actions
for local paper advance and carriage return. With the set’s motor on and Paper
Advance key depressed, the paper continuously advances until key is released.
With the motor on or off, depressing the Local Return key will provide a single
carriage return. Neither operation affects the signal line.

**INTRPT**

**Interrupt Key.** This key, when depressed, initiates a 380 to 690 millisecond
spacing pulse. The pulse, when recognized by a distant transmitting station, can
stop transmission from a keyboard, reader, or other transmitting device as would
be required if some abnormal operating condition existed (i.e., paper or tape
jams or tears).

**HERE-IS**

*Here-Is Key.* The answer-back mechanism is associated with this key. Depressing
the key initiates transmission of a station identification code (or other
information as coded) to a distant terminal.

**OUT-OF-SERVICE**

**Out-of-Service Key and Lamp.** This key, when momentarily depressed,
conditions the “out-of-service” feature that prevents the terminal from
responding to an incoming call. This feature normally is used to allow the
replenishment of paper, ribbons, etc. The associated lamp is “on” when the
“out-of-service” condition exists. It’s restored to normal when key is depressed
and lamp extinguished.

**ERROR**

**Error Key and Lamp.** When the terminal is equipped with vertical parity
detection, this lamp indicates an error condition by lighting upon receipt of a
parity errored character. Depressing the key extinguishes the lamp.

**PTR EOL**

**Printer End-of-Line Lamp.** A lamp is used on the control panel to give visual
indication that the page printer carriage printing position is approaching the
right hand margin. The “end-of-line” indication can be adjusted to take place
anywhere on the page printer platen.

**ALARM**

**Alarm Key and Lamp.** This lamp indicates “paper-out” for pin feed page
printer sets and “low-paper” indication for friction feed sets. If a paper-out”
or “low-paper” condition occurs during transmission, the lamp lights. For
friction and pin feed page printers, upon completing transmission the terminal
won’t respond to further calls until the supply is replenished.

The Alarm lamp is also used in some arrangements to indicate receipt of a
character with incorrect even vertical parity. When an errored character is
received the lamp will light and remain on until the Alarm key is depressed.

**PAPER ALARM**

**Low Paper Alarm Key and Lamp.** This lamp when lighted signifies a “low paper
supply” condition for a friction feed printer or a “paper out” condition for a
pin feed printer. If the alarm was activated by a low or exhausted paper supply
during transmission, the transmission continues until completed. The station
won’t respond to further data service until the paper supply is replenished. At
this time the Alarm lamp is automatically extinguished.

Note: Control panels will not contain a Low Paper Alarm key and lamp or an Error
key and lamp if equipped with the Alarm key and lamp.

*Page 6:*

**KEYBOARD SEND-RECEIVE TERMINALS (KSR)** can be provided with any of the RO
controls in addition to the following:

**PROCEED**

**Proceed Key and Lamp.** The feature associated with this key and lamp enables
the keyboard to respond or not respond under control of a distant transmitting
terminal or computer. The Proceed lamp will be “on” and the keyboard enabled to
respond, when the terminal EIA interface lead “clear- to-send” is “on” and the
terminal has received the ASCII Control Character Acknowledge (ACK).

The Proceed lamp is extinguished and the keyboard in a condition not to respond
by the loss of “clear to send” or upon receipt of the ASCII control character,
Negative Acknowledge (NAK), or upon receipt of an “interrupt” (break) signal.

After contact with a distant terminal has been made, the keyboard can always be
enabled by depressing the Proceed key, or upon receipt of acknowledge (ACK). If
an “interrupt” signal is received, the keyboard can only be enabled to respond
by depressing the Proceed key.

Note: Control of the keyboard by the ASCII control characters, ACK and NAK not
available on some terminals.

**OFF-LINE**

**Off-Line Key and Lamp.** This key when operated places the set off-line with
the motor running. In this mode, the terminal can be used for maintenance,
training, typing practice or miscellaneous uses. The lamp is lighted when in the
“off-line” mode and is extinguished by depressing the associated key. When the
lamp is “off” the motor is controlled by the state of the EIA interface lead
“data set ready”.

**AUTOMATIC SEND-RECEIVE TERMINALS (ASR)** can be provided with any of the RO or
KSR controls in addition to the following:

**PROCEED**

**Proceed Key and Lamp.** On an ASR set, the feature provides identical control
of the keyboard. It also controls the tape reader.

**READER AUTO**

**Automatic Reader Control Key and Lamp.** When the key is depressed its lamp
lights and the station is conditioned for on- line control of the reader. A
second operation of the key extinguishes its light and disables the on-line
reader control feature. On-line or local control of the reader is affected by
the use of the ASCII control character DC1 for “reader on” and DC3 for “reader
off”. Since these controls are interpreted by mechanisms in the page printer,
the printer and reader must both be either in the on-line or off-line mode.

**KBD EOL**

**Keyboard End-of-Line.** This lamp, used in conjunction with a keyboard
character counter, provides visual indication of “end-of-line” condition when
the page printer isn’t utilized as a monitor. On an automatic send-receive set
(ASR), tape can be prepared without page copy by observing the on/off state of
the lamp to judge the end of a printed line.

**KBD LOCAL**

**Keyboard Local Key and Lamp.** When the key is depressed the lamp lights and
the keyboard is placed in “local off-line” circuit. A second operation of the
key extinguishes its lamp and restores the keyboard to on-line condition.

**PRINTER LOCAL**

**Printer Local Key and Lamp.** When key is depressed the lamp lights and the
printer is placed in “local off-line” circuit. A second depression of the key
extinguishes its lamp and restores the printer to on-line condition.

**PUNCH LOCAL**

**Punch Local Key and Lamp.** When key is depressed the lamp lights and the
punch is placed in “local off-line” circuit. The punch selector may or may not
respond depending upon the state of the Punch On key. Depressing the key again
extinguishes its lamp and restores the punch to “on-line” condition.

**PUNCH ON**

**Punch-On Key and Lamp.** When key is depressed the lamp lights and the punch
will respond for tape preparation. A second depression of the key extinguishes
its lamp and the punch will not respond to additional signals. The punch can be
set not to respond either locally or in the on-line mode by the operator.

**READER LOCAL**

**Reader Local Key and Lamp.** Depressing this key places the reader in “local
off-line” circuit and lights the lamp. Depressing the key again allows the
reader to transmit on-line.

All components of an ASR (e.g., printer, keyboard, punch and reader) are
interoperative in either the “on-line” or “local” modes or combinations thereof.
This depends upon the on or off state of the associated control panel light.
Such flexibility permits various modes of operation including simultaneous data
reception and local tape preparation. In addition, the reader can read a variety
of non-ASCII coded tapes, provided the printer or punch is “on-line”.

## Keyboard

\[Photo of keyboard]

The Model 37 keyboard provides a layout of keys similar to a standard office
typewriter. You can generate the entire 128 ASCII character set with an extra
bit to provide even vertical parity over the eight bits.

A pertinent feature of the keyboard permits you to repeat any character desired
by depressing a key beyond its normal stop. Any key can be made repeatable by a
simple field modification. In the standard arrangement, the ten most commonly
used keys in the shift and unshift states are repeatable. They are as follows:

- Line Space
- Space
- Null
- Backspace
- Delete
- Colon (:) or Asterisk (*)
- Hyphen (-) or Equals (= )
- Shift and Unshift Period (.)
- Shift and Unshift Underscore (_)
- Upper and Lower Case X

The keyboard is also equipped to provide control functions. You simply depress
the Control key and the desired graphic key simultaneously. Most control
character designations require using the Control key. Control designations
appear in black on the distinctive dark grey keytop. In addition, commonly used
controls (such as Horizontal Tabulation, Backspace, Carriage Return and Line
Space) are generated by separate keys not requiring operation with the Control
key. Another feature is the override capability of the control key when the
keyboard is in shift-lock condition. This permits generating control characters
without having to unshift.

The following list shows control characters which the Model 37 can generate:

| Keytop Designation | Mnemonic | ASCII Control Character        |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| NULL               | NUL      | Null                           |

| DELETE             | DEL      | Delete*                        |

\*Not a control character in the strict sense. Principally used for deleting
unwanted characters in perforated tape.

NOTE:
- (CC) Communication Control
- (FE) Format Effector
- (IS) Information Separator

Shift characters (those characters on upper portion of keytop) are generated by
depressing the shift key and desired graphic key. The shift state is retained by
operating the shift-lock key. To release back to unshift state, depress the
shift key.

A keyboard interlock prevents errors caused by simultaneous depression of two
keytops.

Keyboard signal output is generated by contacts which provide parallel contact
closures to electronic logic. The logic serializes the keyboard information for
local transmission to a receiving device within the terminal (punch or printer)
or on-line to a distant station. An electrical keyboard blind can be provided to
prevent keyboard transmission when the terminal is receiving. (See control panel
description.)

## Page Printer

\[Photo of page printer]

**Printing.** The 94 printing graphics of the ASCII code are produceable, (the
space and delete characters are not normally printed) and contained in a six row
typebox. The typebox is easily removed for cleaning or substitution by the
operator.

**Platens.** Standard 8 1/2" friction feed platens as well as 9 1/2" overall
paper width pin feed platens are basic to the page printer. Other platens will
be made available for use with the Model 37 printer.*

**Horizontal Spacing.** Ten characters per inch horizontal spacing is standard
on the printer with 12 char./inch spacing optional.

**Line Spacing.** Line spacing is six lines/inch with a lever control selectable
by the operator to provide three lines per inch. Note: Double Line Space (3
lines/inch) not available on page printers equipped with reverse or one-half
forward and reverse Line Space.

**Line Lengths.** Printing line is factory adjusted for 72 characters (normal
margins) with capability up to 80 characters for 8 1/2" friction feed platens
and up to 80 characters with a 9 1/2" pin feed platen. Left and right margins
can be adjusted for almost any length line up to the maximum by a maintenance
man.

**Variable Print Density.** To impart a higher or lower impact to the type
pallets, the operator can adjust the print hammer with a control knob located
conveniently near it. On friction feed page printers this control provides clear
copy on the last sheet of up to three copies (one original and two copies with
necessary carbons or carbon bodied sheets). On pin feed printers this control
provides up to six copies (one original and five tissues with necessary carbon
backing sheets). More copies can be printed depending on the type of paper used.
Friction feed page printers can accept paper rolls from 3" to 8 1/2" wide.* Pin
feed printers can accept forms of overall widths of 9 1/2" Printing occurs
twelve line spaces from the paper tearing edge of the copywindow.

\*For more information see Supplementary Technical Data on pages 26 and 27.

**Backspace.** Correcting errors and special formatting are just two of the uses
for the printer backspace. This feature is controlled by the ASCII control
character for backspace (BS) either on-line from a distant station or locally by
the operator from the keyboard. Receipt of each backspace character backs up the
printing carriage one space.

**Print Position Scale.** A print position scale is just forward of the printer
platen. It’s graduated from one character up to the character limit of the
platen width. This scale makes it easy to determine margins or tab positions
when this information is related in characters from the left edge of the paper
or business form.

**Print Point Indicator.** To aid the operator, a print point indicator moves
along the page printer platen indicating the exact position of the next
character to be printed.

**Stunt Box.** Recognition of control characters and character sequences is
performed by a “Stunt Box.” This mechanical device is similar to the stunt boxes
used on other Teletype page printers and provides the same reliable operation.

Typically, the Stunt Box initiates actions for Carriage Return, Line Space,
Horizontal Tabulation, etc. In addition, contact closures are provided for
terminal disconnect (EOT), Signal Bell, etc.

All control characters sensed by the stunt box, including the space and delete
characters, must be received with correct even vertical parity in order for the
function to be performed. Exception is made for the Carriage Return and Line
Space functions (ASCII Line Feed character).

All graphics in columns 2 through 7 of the ASCII code will print with either
parity. However, the Alarm or Error lamp, as determined by the control panel
arrangement, will light upon receipt of a character with incorrect even vertical
parity.

*Page 9:*

**New Line.** This feature, is standard on the page printer. It provides the
convenience of operating Carriage Return-Line Space functions by depressing only
the Line Space key. When using this feature and operating at 150 words per
minute, two timing or buffer characters are required following the Line Space
character (ASCII Line Feed character- LF). The timing characters can be any
character (e.g., Delete or Null) which doesn’t affect terminal or system
operation. The New Line feature can be easily disabled by the customer, if
desired.* If the feature is not used, one timing character is required following
the Carriage Return- Line Feed sequence when operating at 150 wpm.

\*For more information see Supplementary Technical Data on pages 26 and 27.

**Shift-Out.** This feature, when provided on the page printer, allows printing
16 or 32 special graphics plus the 94 standard printable graphics of the ASCII
code. Type pallets for these extra graphics are handled by either a 7-row
typebox (16 new graphics) or an 8-row typebox (32 new graphics) in place of the
standard 6-row typebox. Rows are added at the top.

Activation of this feature occurs when the page printer receives the ASCII
control character for Shift-Out (SO). All following characters from columns 4 or
5 of the ASCII code will be interpreted as special graphics by the page
printer—then printed using the type pallets in either a 7 or 8-row typebox. The
printer is restored to normal upon receipt of the ASCII control character
Shift-In (SI). While in the SO mode, columns 2 and 3 print in the normal manner,
allowing access to numerics and punctuation marks. Also, the unit continues to
respond to control characters in the SO mode.

When used with Backspace, Half Line Space, Full Reverse Line Space, Horizontal
and Vertical Tabulation features, there’s virtually no special format (including
charts, graphs, etc.) which can’t be handled by the Model 37 terminal. Weather,
medical, chemical, mathematical, scientific,and an unlimited number of other
special symbols can be utilized.

Design of the typebox allows incorporation of many special type pallets which
are currently available. The pallets can be found in Teletype Bulletin, No.
1164B.

**Horizontal Tabulation and Tab Setting.** Besides horizontal tabulation, the
page printer is capable of horizontal tabulation stop setting, from on-line
signals generated from a distant station or locally from the keyboard.
Formatting which previously required maintenance man setting of each tab stop
for a purchase order, invoice, etc., has been eliminated. Tab stops for each
character position on the platen are set up by a two-character sequence and the
tabs cleared for a new format with another two-character sequence. After the
desired tab stops are set, the operator tabs to the required position on the
form either locally or on-line by merely depressing the Tab keytop on the
keyboard. Depressing the key generates the ASCII Horizontal Tabulation (HT)
control character. The carriage will tab at approximately three times the rate
of normal spacing.

**Vertical Tabulation and Tab Setting.** Vertical tabulation, an aid in form
preparation, is available on the page printer.

It’s operator controlled from the keyboard and by on-line signals from a distant
terminal using the ASCII Vertical Tabulation (VT) control character.
Furthermore, when changing from one form to another, the printer’s tab setting
feature allows a vertical tab stop to be set for every line position by a
two-character sequence from the keyboard or on-line from a distant station. Tabs
can be cleared for another format by using another two-character sequence.
Vertical tabulation takes place at approximately three times the rate of normal
line spacing,

**Form-Feed.** This feature is associated with vertical tabulation and aids in
preparing forms or other material. It allows the operator to select and set the
first printing line of a form. When the ASCII character for Form-Feed (FF) is
received the page will feed at approximately three times the rate of normal line
spacing to the first printing line on the next form. Form-Feed is
non-repeatable. It won’t respond unless each Form-Feed character is separated by
an ASCII Line Feed control character.

This feature conserves forms if a Form-Feed character is received when the page
printer is in print position.

Both friction and pin feed printers use this feature. They’re presently offered
equipped to form-feed 11 inches. Various length form-feed parts will be
available to handle forms up to 15 inches in length.

**Reverse Line Space and Half Forward and Reverse Line Spacing.** These
features, controlled by two-character sequences, enable the operator or a
distant terminal to follow formats which had been previously impractical or
impossible. In addition, correction of errors, printing of fractions, and other
operations are easily accomplished. When these features are in a page printer
with Vertical Tabulation and Form Feed, the line spacing rate of the Vertical
Tabulation and Form Feed is approximately one and one-half times the normal rate
of line spacing (and the Double Line Space feature is not provided).

*Page 10:*

**Two Color Printing.** This feature, controlled by the operator or on-line from
a distant terminal, responds to a two-character sequence for one color and
another two-character sequence for the other color. Normally, printing will be
red-black.

This feature has many uses. For example: Computer-linked terminals could be
assigned black for data transmitted to the computer while the computer could
reply with red printed data. This simply requires, in this example, that the
computer prefaces a statement to the terminal with the proper two-character
sequence for red printing and terminates the statement with the proper sequence
for black printing. In addition, editing, highlighting, etc., can be done
locally or on-line.

When a terminal is turned on, the ribbon will shift to the ribbon color chosen
for the terminal. When using red-black ribbons, terminals normally are in the
state to print in black.

**Escape.** Control functions other than those defined by specific ASCII control
characters are initiated by using the ASCII control character Escape (ESC)
followed by a graphic character. (Escape is designated on the keyboard as the
Prefix keytop).

Recognition of “escape” sequences is performed by the stunt box which, in turn,
activates the selected control function. Printing is suppressed for all
characters in the Escape sequence. The page printer always returns to the
unsuppressed mode after the graphic character unless the graphic of the “escape”
sequence is in column 2 of the ASCII code. Print and space suppression will be
affected continually as long as all following graphics are from this row.

The control function description for the “escape” sequence is labeled on the
control panel above the top row of keytops on the keyboard and is as follows:

| SEQUENCE                          | FUNCTION                |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Prefix followed by Numeric 1      | Horizontal Tab set      |

## Control Logic Module

\[Photo of control logic module]

The Model 37 control logic module is approximately 5 3/4" wide, 13" deep and 20"
high. This module mounts in the lower portion of the KSR or RO cabinet, and
connects to the keyboard, printer, etc., with plug-in cables. It’s designed for
easy maintenance by utilizing electronic circuit cards containing standard
electronic components and micrologic elements. Options are implemented by
substituting cards, adding cards, adding cards onto existing cards in piggyback
fashion, and adding or removing wire straps.

The following are the main functions and features of the control logic module:

**Interface.** Model 37 terminal interface meets requirements of Electronics
Industries Association Standard RS-232-B. Most applications require no coupling
device between the Model 37 terminal and the data set. Installation and
maintenance of the terminal are thus simplified.

**Set Control Logic.** Send control logic controls all sending devices such as
the keyboard, reader, or answer-back mechanism. Control is accomplished by
channeling the signaling information from these devices to either local internal
signal circuits or on-line signal circuits.

*Page 11:*

Receive control logic controls incoming data to the proper receiving units.
These units include the page printer or the punch of the punch and reader
module.

Mode control logic provides set timing and controls the operation of all sending
or receiving devices on-line or in local mode in “on” or “off” condition.

Channel control logic provides information to a data set or a similar control
device concerning the terminal’s receiving status. It also accepts information
about the line connection status of the terminal. In addition to the above
controls, each sending or receiving device (for example, the answer-back,
printer and keyboard) has associated logic.

**Automatic Motor Control.** Model 37 terminal motors are on only when required.
Local control of motors is provided by control panel keys while on-line control
is provided by the “on” or “off” state of the EIA Interface lead “data set
ready.”

When on-line, the motors are turned off and the terminal deactivated upon
receipt of ASCII End-Of-Transmission character (EOT).

**Answer-Back Mechanism.** This unit plugs into the control logic module. It
provides a 20 character programmable character sequence when activated by (1)
detection (ENQ character or by (2) operation of Here-Is key on control panel or
by (3) the data set or control device at the beginning of a call by an “on”
condition at the EIA interface lead, “ring indicator.”

**Received Signal Regenerator.** This feature allows terminal tolerance of up to
40% signal distortion on receive data lead input.* Optional features (for use
with the regenerator) detect incorrect vertical parity and provide visual
indication of this condition.

\*For more information see Supplementary Technical Data on pages 26 and 27.

**On-Line Control of Home Copy:** By providing recognition of a two character
sequence, Model 37 terminal can print any information transmitted from its
sending devices or received from a distant station (Home Copy Mode-Half-Duplex).
After receipt of another two character sequence, the terminal stops printing
information from its sending devices and only responds to on-line signals
(Full-Duplex). The terminal will be in “Home Copy-Mode” at the beginning of
transmission. An option is available for the customer to permanently strap the
terminal in the “Full” or “Half-Duplex” modes.

**Character Counter.** With this feature you get a visual indication on the
terminal control panel (Keyboard End-of-Line lamp) whenever a preset number of
graphic characters and spaces are generated from the keyboard.

The unit counts down on Backspace. It won’t count control characters or those
characters included in two character “escape” sequences.

Resetting the Character Counter is accomplished by the ASCII control character
Line Feed (New Line). The counter can be optionally reset on the Carriage Return
and Line Feed character sequence if the New Line feature is not desired, by
cutting a strap on the counter circuit card located within the control logic
module.

**Signal Bell.** An alarm or attention device that responds to the ASCII Bell
character. In addition, it can signal a distant station of an important message,
an abnormal operating condition, etc.

## Cabinets, Paper Handling and Miscellaneous

**Console Assembly.** This assembly houses the typing unit, base, keyboard,
motor assembly, and control panel. The assembly is mounted on a desk type table
arrangement that houses the terminal control logic module.

**Copylights.** The console assembly provides a pair of copy- lights for easy
copy viewing. There is also a convenient paper tearing edge on the copy viewing
window.

**Tables.** Two tables are available for Model 37terminals. Both are shown on
the particular feature charts.

Wide tables provide space to the right and below the printer console to house
data sets or similar devices. Dimensions of this opening are 22" deep x 8 3 /4"
wide x 21" high. Also, convenient workspace is provided for the operator on the
table to the right of the printer console.

Narrow tables are similar to the wide tables except for omission of space to the
right of the printer console. These tables are normally used where space is a
factor in the application. A data set mounting shelf will be available for
narrow tables.

*Page 12:*

**Power Distribution Panel.** The table houses a convenient AC input power
distribution panel. This panel provides power outlets for such terminal
components as the control logic module, punch and reader module, etc. It also
provides outlets for maintenance equipment or other devices. Primary AC power
input originates from a single power cord. A single AC circuit breaker located
on this panel controls input power (with individual fuses for various other
power outputs located on the control logic module front panel.)

**Paper Handling.** paper hand ling options are offered for either front or rear
paper loading. Present sets use forms 11" long and 9 1/2" wide. A form
accumulator (rear of printer console) conveniently stacks the printed forms.

Parts to equip terminals to handle most commonly used form sizes will be made
available. See Supplementary Technical Data on pages 26 and 27.

## Punch and Reader Module

\[Photo of punch and reader module]

This unit consists of a tape punch and reader mounted in a cabinet assembly.
When placed adjacent and electrically connected to an appropriate keyboard
send-receive set (KSR) the combination forms an automatic send-receive set
(ASR).

**Speed.** The punch and reader module can read and punch tape at 150 words per
minute. You can operate it in a variety of “on-line” and “off-line” combinations
with the keyboard and the page printer. This versatility allows data
transmission at the on-line rate of 150 words per minute since messages can be
punched in an “off-line” mode. In addition, the tape punch can operate on-line
to provide a machine readable record of any desired incoming information.

**Tape Supply.** A supply container for a standard 8" roll of tape (nominally
1,000 ft.) is provided in the cabinet for the tape punch and is easily
accessible under the hinged punch cover assembly. The cabinet top is also hinged
and provides easy access to the internal components of the punch and reader for
maintenance.

**Tape Handling.** Tape handling options include an intermediate tape storage
bin which handles approximately 50 feet of perforated tape. Other tape handling
combinations are available which may include any of the following:

1. One tape winder, handles one standard 8" roll (nominally 1,000 ft.)
2. One tape winder, and a combination winder and power unwinder, each having a
   capacity for a standard 8" roll (nominally 1,000 ft.)

### PUNCH

\[Photo of tape punch]

**Tape.** A non-typing punch is an integral part of the module. The unit
produces 8-level fully punched tape conforming to USAS X3.18.

*Page 13:*

**Backspace.** The unit is equipped with off-line backspace. For each operation
of the Backspace key, the punch backspaces the tape one-character interval. The
key is located on the module control panel.

**Tape Feed-Out.** A manually operated tape feed-out arrangement is provided.
When the Feed-Out lever, located inside the cover, is operated, Delete
characters are perforated at the machine rate of 150 words per minute. The
feed-out is an “interfering-type” arrangement. Consequently, it obliterates the
character punched if signals are received during its operation. Feed-out is
normally used only when threading tape.

**Punch Control.** The punch can be operated in response to on-line signals.
This feature is part of the page printer and control logic of the ASR set. When
the ASCII control character DC2 is received, the punch is activated. When the
control character DC4 is received, the punch is deactivated.

**Operator Aids.** A clear plastic container for tape chad is located on the
cabinet where it’s easily seen by the operator. Under this arrangement the
chance of chad being spilled is eliminated. Another operator aid, the Alarm lamp
on the punch and reader control panel, lights up when the tape supply roll is
approximately 2 1/2" in diameter (25' to 30' of tape remaining).

### READER

\[Photo of tape reader]

**Tape.** The reader senses fully perforated eight-level tape conforming to USAS
X3.18.

**Tape Alarms.** A tape-out sensor (located in the reader) gives the operator
visual indication of a “Tape-Out” condition by lighting the tape Alarm lamp on
the module control panel. In addition, tape sensing is also stopped. Since this
sensor is located 4 characters ahead of sensing, a trailer of at least 4
characters is required at end of message.

A Tight Tape switch is provided on the cabinet between the punch and the reader.
Should the punching and reading take place simultaneously, the tape won’t tear
if the slack between punch and reader is taken up since the switch stops the
reader until slack is present. In addition, the Alarm lamp lights up when this
condition occurs.

**Reader Step.** A Reader Step key is located on the module control panel. Each
time depressed, it steps the reader forward one character (reader switch must be
in stop position). The character will be read and transmitted.

**Reader Control.** A Run-Stop-Free switch is located on the reader. When in
“Free” the feed wheel is free and the tape may be pulled through the reading
head without opening the tape lid. The switch is operated to “Run” position when
tape is in place and ready for transmission. When in “Stop” or “Free” tape
transmission can’t take place.

**Automatic Reader Control.** This feature operates in conjunction with a key on
the printer console control panel (Reader Auto). When this key is depressed the
reader turns “on” when the terminal receives the ASCII control character DC1 and
turns “off” upon receipt of control character DC3. Reader can be controlled
on-line or off-line.

Control logic is available (within the KSR portion of the ASR set) to provide a
one-character delay (optionally) after a control character is read. This
minimizes the need for fill characters. The feature stops the reader on the
control character, Read.

**Punch and Reader Control Logic.** The punch and reader utilizes control logic,
consisting of circuit cards and necessary internal wiring housed in a metal
framed module mounted internal to the cabinet. This unit is approximately 5 3/4"
wide, 13" deep and 14V2 " high. It also contains necessary interconnecting
cabling and a power cord that plugs into the appropriate KSR set.

**Transmitting and Receiving Margins**

**Transmitting Margins.** Bit tinning: Any transition will be within 5% of a bit
length from its correct transition point relative to the beginning of the start
bit of the character. Minimum character length at 150 words per minute code will
be 9.95 units.

**Receiving Margins.** Model 37 terminals equipped with a receiving signal
regenerator and operating at 150 words per minute, 10 unit code are capable of
correct operation with signals containing up to 40% telegraph distortion. This
distortion is defined as the measure of the maximum displacement of any
mark-to-space or space-to-mark transition in a character as referenced from the
initial mark to space transition of the start element.

Platens will be available from 3%" to 9" form widths.

**Typing Unit Paper.** The following are the dimensions of the standard yellow
paper roll for friction feed printers available from paper suppliers.

- Outside diameter: 5"
- Width: 8.453" ± .031"
