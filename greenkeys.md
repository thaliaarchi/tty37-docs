  Evolution of Models 26, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, and 38, including:
  > The design of the Model 28 started in about 1953 and many are still in use.
  > The same design was used with few modifications for the Model 29, 34, 35 and
  > also was the basis for the Model 37... the last real Teletype machine before
  > the entrance of ink jet, dot matrix and chain printers.
  >
  > The model 38 was based on the Model 33 with features similar to the 37. The
  > 37 would have been more successful if it had been released sooner with a
  > better keyboard and a more reliable reperforator, or with a magnetic tape
  > terminal.

  Murray and Gothic typefaces:
  > -- I've received a Teletype Corp bulletin, of 1960 September vintage, with a
  > list of typepallets (characters) available for Model 28s as of that date. Of
  > these characters, I have physical samples for the following in the Murray
  > typeface:
  > - letters: A through Z.
  > - numerals: 0 1 through 9.
  > - punctuation: - + bell $ ! # & ' " ( ) / : ; ? , .
  > - vulgar fractions: 1/8 1/4 3/8 1/2 5/8 3/4 7/8
  > - weather cloud cover symbols:
  >   - clear - circle
  >   - scattered - circle containing one vertical line
  >   - broken - circle containing two parallel vertical lines
  >   - overcast - circle containing a cross.
  > - wind direction arrows, pointing in 8 directions: NE E SE S SW W NW N.
  >
  > -- At least three other typefaces were available: Gothic, Long Gothic and
  > Large Gothic. […]
  >
  > -- Since 1960, I understand that additional typepallets were produced for
  > other Latin characters used in Spanish, and some other miscellaneous
  > characters (including vulgar fractions of all sorts of odd-ball units, such
  > as twelfths and sixths). […]
  >
  > -- A Cyrillic set was produced for Teletype machines used in Fort Detrick,
  > Frederick Maryland at the US end of the Washington-Moscow hotline. […]
  >
  > -- I have learned the Model 35 used the same kind of typebox mechanism with
  > typepallets. But I don't know if the characters looked the same as the
  > 'Murray' style. If so, a sample would really help.
  >
  > -- And... the Model 37 had an expanded typebox with typepallets, and it had
  > lower-case! Were these of the same Murray style? […]
  >
  > -- Lastly, I have located the extent archives of Teletype Corporation
  > (including machines!). They are in New Jersey under the care of the AT&T
  > Archivist. […] And, it's not free: I have to pay for an exploratory search.

On Model 37 type pallets:

- [2010-04-23](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-April/016614.html):
  > There are two M37 type boxes up for bids on eBay. One is special in that
  > half the type pallets are missing. The other is full with all of the
  > standard pallets. I am hoping to win it as I am missing the type box for one
  > of my two Model 37 machines.
  >
  > Teletype would provide whatever pallets the customer needed. The Model 37
  > had more pallets available than any other machine I am aware of.
  >
  > The keyboards were not friendly and we technicians had a heck of a time when
  > the customer needed a special key top. Most of the machines I worked on were
  > at Western Electric's office in Rolling Meadows, IL. Thank goodness they
  > used the standard type box and keyboard.
  >
  > The 37 was a neat machine in that it had just about all options customers
  > had asked for... Here are some of the more interesting features and
  > options..
  >
  > - RED/BLACK Ribbon.
  > - Reverse Line Feed.
  > - On line TAB set and TAB CLEAR for both horizontal and vertical tabs.
  > - Upper and lower case characters.
  >
  > The design of the typing unit was nice. Too bad the keyboard was not as well
  > designed. A character was printed through the use of both a front plate and
  > a side plate. This enabled the machine to type one character and move to the
  > next character without going back to home. Weird to watch.
  >
  > The selector clutch on both the typing unit and the reperforator had two
  > stops on it each character code was formed in one half of a revolution. So
  > when operating at 150 wpm the shaft was actually turning at a lower speed
  > than that of the Model 35 running at 100 wpm.
  >
  > The last Teletype Test Boards built by Teletype and Western Electric had a
  > marvelous and complex Electrical Service Unit. A set of buttons across the
  > front of the cover on the typing unit selected the following....
  >
  > 5 Level 60, 5 Level 75, 5 Level 100, 8 Level 100, 8 Level 150. The ESU
  > changed all the codes to 8 Level 150 to feed the selector. Sadly I missed a
  > chance to obtain one of the test board positions in Pac Bell. I also missed
  > a chance to get an older test board position in Chicago Franklin.

On character movement and speeds:

- [2003-02-12](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2003-February/002003.html):
  > Almost all machines perform a complete rotation, stop and latch clutches
  > during the stop pulse to get ready for the next character. The 37 has two
  > stop clutches so that the character is printed in one half of a revolution.
  > It also does not go back to "home" after each character, it goes from one to
  > the next, to the next. To accomplish this it not only has a "front plate"
  > but also a "side plate" for the extra positioning work. So even though it is
  > printing at 150 wpm the shaft speed is slower than the 35 or 28 at 100 wpm.
- [2005-04-01](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2005-April/005848.html):
  > the typebox moved straight from one char to the next without going past a
  > neutral resting spot between chars
- [2008-11-15](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-November/012473.html):
  > That is what is neat about the Model 37 and a few older Teletype models that
  > set up a character in one-half revolution of the shaft. So the operations
  > per minute would surprise people.
- [2008-11-15](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-November/012463.html):
  Calculation of more accurate baud rates and wpm than the published rounded
  numbers.

On the Model 37 stunt box:

- [2003-11-11](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2003-November/003097.html):
  > I am not sure of the designation, but the M33, 35, 37 all had the capability
  > to use an electronic selective calling unit, called STUNTRONICS. The unit
  > fit in the base and had jumpers to set the address for the machine. This was
  > especially important for the Model 33 that needed to be turned on only when
  > it needed to be, due to wear factors and limited stuntbox functions. As I
  > recall the Magnetic Tape Terminal 4210 could also use the selective calling
  > unit.
  >
  > Of course the model 35 and 37 also had normal stuntbox capability. In the
  > case of the M37 the stuntbox also had extention cables to control such
  > features as red/black ribbon shift, and on-line tab set and tab clear.

On mechanical over electrical operation:

- [2010-03-15](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-March/016249.html),
  [2010-03-16](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-March/016260.html),
  [2010-03-16](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-March/016262.html):
  In response to a 1917 Bachelor's thesis on Morkrum machines:
  > > The Morkrum machines had far more electrical parts than the later Teletype
  > > machines. There were about 16 relays and six magnets in the Morkrum
  > > machine. Later machines were simpler electrically and had more mechanical
  > > logic. The Model 12 also had relay decoding of incoming characters, with
  > > one magnet for each bit. The Model 15, with all decoding done mechanically
  > > and only one selector magnet, had the fewest electrical parts.
  >
  > And the Model 14 before it. Legend is that the Model 14/15 single-magnet
  > selector was sketched by Howard Krum on a napkin at a hot dog joint on Coney
  > Island.
  >
  > He wrote about 1925 "These first tests also pointed out the advantages and
  > superiority of mechanical over electrical operation, with a result that all
  > functions outside of the bare selection are now performed mechanically by
  > the Teletype in its present form."
  >
  > Unfortunately this mind-set persisted well into the 1960s, when the
  > designers of the Model 37 spent far too much time developing an 8-level
  > mechanical selector that would operate well at 150 baud. Had they settled
  > for a parallel-input printer with an electronic selector, and put more
  > effort into a better keyboard, the machine might have been a success.
  > However the daisywheels and the dot matrix machines were nipping at its
  > heels.
  >
  > A. H. Reiber of Teletype patented a daisy wheel printer in 1939, at which
  > time it was not very practical to make; and I suppose by the 1960s it had
  > been forgotten. (Patent 2,146,380)

On horizontal tabs:

- [2006-01-05](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2006-January/006950.html):
  > Horizontal tabulation was an optional feature on Model 28, and even on
  > Model 15. It was not very neat, because you had to give up some upper case
  > character to do the tab function, and it took a repair technician to set the
  > tabs. But some customers demanded it. It was a little cleaner in Model 35
  > since a character could be devoted to it in the ASCII character set. Model
  > 37 was to have online settable tabs, as many CRT terminals do.
  >
  > In early days of computer terminal use, for instance with the original
  > Dartmouth BASIC timesharing system, a convention was established that tabs
  > were to be every 8 characters. If you pressed the TAB key the computer would
  > convert that into the right number of spaces to move the carriage to the
  > next tab position. In later timesharing systems there was a switch so that
  > if the terminal really had a tab function the computer would send the tab
  > character; otherwise it would use the 8-character column convention and
  > simulate the tab with spaces. Still later there were schemes to set the tabs
  > on a terminal with online settable tabs, but they would normally be set to
  > the 8-character column positions. If you wanted them somewhere else you were
  > pretty much on your own.

On ribbons:

- [2009-02-14](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2009-February/013557.html):
  > > > I was wondering if there is any way to re-ink TTY ribbons?
  > >
  > > Why bother? They're easily available. Just order NuKote B76 ribbons.
  > >
  > > http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EFJY8U
  > >
  > > $3.82 each from Amazon. Teletype models 12, 15, and I think the 28/33/35
  > > series all run on old-style Underwood typewriter ribbons.
  >
  > Models 12,14,15,19,20,26,28,32,32,33,35 all use the Underwood style BLACK
  > RECORD ribbon. \
  > The Model 37 and 38 use the same ribbon but in BLACK/RED RECORD. \
  > The Model 40 and 45 both use a special large ribbon on a large spool.
  >
  > The Kleinschmidt machines use the ribbons produced for the SCM typewriters.
  > The spools are different than the Underwood type.

  [2009-07-01](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2009-July/014934.html):
  A version of the Model 15 had a carriage moving right-to-left which printed
  Hebrew and a version of either the 37 or 38 (uncertain) printed backwards.

On Model 37 second-hand purchases:

- [2008-01-19](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-January/010743.html):
  > I also paid $145. for a Model 37 ASR that was used on the Hot Line to
  > Moscow.
- [2008-05-25](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-May/011353.html):
  > found a company willing to make both the 32, 33, and 38 print hammers and
  > the 28, 35, and 37 reperf hammers. but the up front $600. tooling cost was
  > too high for us.

On locations of Model 37s:
- [2010-04-15](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-April/016517.html),
  [2010-12-05](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-December/017901.html):
  The Model 37 ASR at the Museum of Communications, Seattle was probably donated
  by Don Robert House.

On Model 37s sold to the Soviet Union:

- [2007-11-06](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2007-November/010139.html):
  > Teletype did sell many model 37s to the Soviet Union. My TTY Corp
  > instructor was sent over there to train their people on them.
- [2010-08-06](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-August/017301.html):
  > many Model 37 teletypes were bought by Russia - the Model 37 is an ASCII
  > machine that will print lower-case, and the Russians fitted them with
  > Cyrillic type blocks.

On similarity to other machines:

- [2010-10-03](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-October/017630.html):
  Kleinschmidt Model 321:
  > Kleinschmidt/SCM produced a machine called a 321 ADS. It had an engraved
  > drum very much like the UGC74A. It also had a TD and reperf on the table.
  > The configuration was similar to a Teletype Model 37ASR, physically.

  > In the book 'RTTY from A to Z" by Durward J. Tucker (1970) there are
  > pictures and descriptions of both the 311 and 321 - pages 153 and 154.

On Model 37 relation to stock tickers:

- [2003-04-11](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2003-April/002385.html):
  > the "Teletype 900" tickers […] were designed using Model 37 technology and
  > that sure explains why they were short-lived. Any Model 37 I ever met had a
  > genetic desire to self-destruct.
- [2010-01-02](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-January/015793.html):
  > The Dow-Jones printer was known as the "Broad Tape." It printed on a paper
  > roll that was 5 inches wide - hence the name. For more information on the
  > Dow-Jones printer, go to the following URL:
  > http://www.lostwackys.com/tickers/dow-jones/ \
  > […] the newer ticker (which used an aggregate motion linkage like the
  > Model 37) couldn't keep up with the trading on busy days and it was gone in
  > a few years.
- [2010-06-12](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-June/016909.html):
  > when the new stock ticker based on Model 37 printer came out I think it used
  > a different width of ticker tape than its predecessor.

On the advanced Model 37:

- [2005-06-28](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2005-June/006150.html):
  > The 37 was mechanically speaking, the "end of our era", the last to use
  > "type box & peckerhead" technology, to revive the terms used by one of my
  > former Navy trained, Bell System employed teletype repairman!
