  Evolution of Models 26, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, and 38, including:
  > The design of the Model 28 started in about 1953 and many are still in use.
  > The same design was used with few modifications for the Model 29, 34, 35 and
  > also was the basis for the Model 37... the last real Teletype machine before
  > the entrance of ink jet, dot matrix and chain printers.
  >
  > The model 38 was based on the Model 33 with features similar to the 37. The
  > 37 would have been more successful if it had been released sooner with a
  > better keyboard and a more reliable reperforator, or with a magnetic tape
  > terminal.

On documentation:

  The [Antique Wireless Museum Library](https://www.antiquewireless.org/homepage/museum/)
  has a copy of the Teletype Corp. Museum list, which describes and photographed
  various Teletype models in twelve volumes of 30–50 pages each. The poster,
  Duncan Brown, intended to scan and index it.

  Murray and Gothic typefaces:
  > -- I've received a Teletype Corp bulletin, of 1960 September vintage, with a
  > list of typepallets (characters) available for Model 28s as of that date. Of
  > these characters, I have physical samples for the following in the Murray
  > typeface:
  > - letters: A through Z.
  > - numerals: 0 1 through 9.
  > - punctuation: - + bell $ ! # & ' " ( ) / : ; ? , .
  > - vulgar fractions: 1/8 1/4 3/8 1/2 5/8 3/4 7/8
  > - weather cloud cover symbols:
  >   - clear - circle
  >   - scattered - circle containing one vertical line
  >   - broken - circle containing two parallel vertical lines
  >   - overcast - circle containing a cross.
  > - wind direction arrows, pointing in 8 directions: NE E SE S SW W NW N.
  >
  > -- At least three other typefaces were available: Gothic, Long Gothic and
  > Large Gothic. […]
  >
  > -- Since 1960, I understand that additional typepallets were produced for
  > other Latin characters used in Spanish, and some other miscellaneous
  > characters (including vulgar fractions of all sorts of odd-ball units, such
  > as twelfths and sixths). […]
  >
  > -- A Cyrillic set was produced for Teletype machines used in Fort Detrick,
  > Frederick Maryland at the US end of the Washington-Moscow hotline. […]
  >
  > -- I have learned the Model 35 used the same kind of typebox mechanism with
  > typepallets. But I don't know if the characters looked the same as the
  > 'Murray' style. If so, a sample would really help.
  >
  > -- And... the Model 37 had an expanded typebox with typepallets, and it had
  > lower-case! Were these of the same Murray style? […]
  >
  > -- Lastly, I have located the extent archives of Teletype Corporation
  > (including machines!). They are in New Jersey under the care of the AT&T
  > Archivist. […] And, it's not free: I have to pay for an exploratory search.

  Type pallets:
  > There are several types of pallets for the 28, 35, and 37 machines: Murray,
  > Gothic, Long Gothic just to name a few.

On character movement and speeds:

- [2003-02-12](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2003-February/002003.html):
  > Almost all machines perform a complete rotation, stop and latch clutches
  > during the stop pulse to get ready for the next character. The 37 has two
  > stop clutches so that the character is printed in one half of a revolution.
  > It also does not go back to "home" after each character, it goes from one to
  > the next, to the next. To accomplish this it not only has a "front plate"
  > but also a "side plate" for the extra positioning work. So even though it is
  > printing at 150 wpm the shaft speed is slower than the 35 or 28 at 100 wpm.
- [2005-04-01](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2005-April/005848.html):
  > the typebox moved straight from one char to the next without going past a
  > neutral resting spot between chars
- [2008-11-15](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-November/012473.html):
  > That is what is neat about the Model 37 and a few older Teletype models that
  > set up a character in one-half revolution of the shaft. So the operations
  > per minute would surprise people.
- [2008-11-15](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-November/012463.html):
  Calculation of more accurate baud rates and wpm than the published rounded
  numbers.

On the Model 37 stunt box:

- [2003-11-11](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2003-November/003097.html):
  > I am not sure of the designation, but the M33, 35, 37 all had the capability
  > to use an electronic selective calling unit, called STUNTRONICS. The unit
  > fit in the base and had jumpers to set the address for the machine. This was
  > especially important for the Model 33 that needed to be turned on only when
  > it needed to be, due to wear factors and limited stuntbox functions. As I
  > recall the Magnetic Tape Terminal 4210 could also use the selective calling
  > unit.
  >
  > Of course the model 35 and 37 also had normal stuntbox capability. In the
  > case of the M37 the stuntbox also had extention cables to control such
  > features as red/black ribbon shift, and on-line tab set and tab clear.

On horizontal tabs:

- [2006-01-05](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2006-January/006950.html):
  > Horizontal tabulation was an optional feature on Model 28, and even on
  > Model 15. It was not very neat, because you had to give up some upper case
  > character to do the tab function, and it took a repair technician to set the
  > tabs. But some customers demanded it. It was a little cleaner in Model 35
  > since a character could be devoted to it in the ASCII character set. Model
  > 37 was to have online settable tabs, as many CRT terminals do.
  >
  > In early days of computer terminal use, for instance with the original
  > Dartmouth BASIC timesharing system, a convention was established that tabs
  > were to be every 8 characters. If you pressed the TAB key the computer would
  > convert that into the right number of spaces to move the carriage to the
  > next tab position. In later timesharing systems there was a switch so that
  > if the terminal really had a tab function the computer would send the tab
  > character; otherwise it would use the 8-character column convention and
  > simulate the tab with spaces. Still later there were schemes to set the tabs
  > on a terminal with online settable tabs, but they would normally be set to
  > the 8-character column positions. If you wanted them somewhere else you were
  > pretty much on your own.

On ribbons:

- [2009-02-14](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2009-February/013557.html):
  > > > I was wondering if there is any way to re-ink TTY ribbons?
  > >
  > > Why bother? They're easily available. Just order NuKote B76 ribbons.
  > >
  > > http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EFJY8U
  > >
  > > $3.82 each from Amazon. Teletype models 12, 15, and I think the 28/33/35
  > > series all run on old-style Underwood typewriter ribbons.
  >
  > Models 12,14,15,19,20,26,28,32,32,33,35 all use the Underwood style BLACK
  > RECORD ribbon. \
  > The Model 37 and 38 use the same ribbon but in BLACK/RED RECORD. \
  > The Model 40 and 45 both use a special large ribbon on a large spool.
  >
  > The Kleinschmidt machines use the ribbons produced for the SCM typewriters.
  > The spools are different than the Underwood type.

On printing in reverse:

- [2009-06-30](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2009-June/014932.html),
  [2009-07-01](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2009-July/014934.html):
  A version of the Model 15 had a carriage moving right-to-left which printed
  Hebrew and a version of either the 37 or 38 (uncertain) printed backwards.

On Model 37 second-hand purchases:

- [2008-01-19](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-January/010743.html):
  > I also paid $145. for a Model 37 ASR that was used on the Hot Line to
  > Moscow.
- [2008-05-25](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2008-May/011353.html):
  > found a company willing to make both the 32, 33, and 38 print hammers and
  > the 28, 35, and 37 reperf hammers. but the up front $600. tooling cost was
  > too high for us.

On locations of Model 37s:
- [2010-04-15](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2010-April/016517.html):
  The Model 37 ASR at the Museum of Communications, Seattle was probably donated
  by Don Robert House.

On Model 37s sold to the Soviet Union:

- [2007-11-06](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2007-November/010139.html):
  > Teletype did sell many model 37s to the Soviet Union. My TTY Corp
  > instructor was sent over there to train their people on them.

On Model 37 unreliability and relation to stock tickers:

- [2003-04-11](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2003-April/002385.html):
  > the "Teletype 900" [stock] tickers […] were designed using Model 37
  > technology and that sure explains why they were short-lived. Any Model 37 I
  > ever met had a genetic desire to self-destruct.

On the advanced Model 37:

- [2005-06-28](https://mailman.qth.net/pipermail/greenkeys/2005-June/006150.html):
  > The 37 was mechanically speaking, the "end of our era", the last to use
  > "type box & peckerhead" technology, to revive the terms used by one of my
  > former Navy trained, Bell System employed teletype repairman!
