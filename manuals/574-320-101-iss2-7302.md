Figure 1 - 37 Typing Unit With Variable Features

1.01 This section describes the late design 37 typing unit (Figure 1) and the
wide platen typing unit (Figure 11). This is a general revision which includes
all previously issued supplementary information concerning the description and
principles of operation of the wide platen typing unit. Since this section is a
general revision, marginal arrows normally used to indicate changes or
additions, have been omitted.

*Page 2:*

1.02 The purpose of the unit is to translate electrical code signals into
printed graphics or functions. Other units that support normal operation of the
typing unit include a base with intermediate gear assembly, motor unit, and
electrical service unit. The support units are described in their appropriate
sections.

1.03 The 37 typing unit can be operated at speeds up to 150 words p€r minute.
The selector mechanism of the typing unit receives 10-unit, 8-level serial code.

1.04 Of the eight levels of code information, four levels are used to position
the typebox horizontally, and three levels are used to position the typebox
vertically. The eighth level is not used in typebox positioning. The horizontal
and vertical positioning mechanisms utilize the aggregate motion principle, and
respond immediately to repositioned codebars.

1.05 All eight levels of the ASCII (American National Standard Code for
Information Interchange) system can be sensed by the function mechanism. Seven
levels define a character, and the eighth (parity) level verifies accuracy of
transmission. When parity is used, a function cannot occur unless parity is
correct.

## 2. DESCRIPTION

### BASIC UNIT

2.01 The typing unit contains the basic mechanisms to print a graphic or perform
a function. Rotational motion is applied to the main shaft assembly for
distribution to all mechanisms within the unit, and is extended to the keyboard
reset coupler for driving a separately mounted, keyboard reset mechanism.

2.02 The selector (Figure 2) translates a serial code input into a corresponding
mechanical code output. In 8-level, serial code reception, a combination of
eight code bits preceded by a start interval (always spacing) and concluded with
a stop pulse (always marking) establishes a character. The nonprinting character
(if assigned) is a function, and the printing character is a graphic.

2.03 The major mechanisms and variable features are described in Figures 2
through 9. Variable features are options which may be selected to increase the
functions of a basic typing unit.

2.04 The Model 37 can be broken down into five major subassemblies and a main
frame assembly. The subassemblies are: main shaft, function box, selector,
vertical position and a front plate assembly which contains the horizontal
positioning.

2.05 The typing unit is designed to be used with a base unit. Refer to Section
574-331-100 which gives the necessary rigidity to the printer frame. The typing
unit should never be operated under power when loose on the base unit or a
comparable supporting baseplate.

<u>CAUTION</u>: ALWAYS CHECK TO INSURE THAT THE TYPING UNIT IS PROPERLY SECURED
TOA BASE BEFORE OPERATING.

2.06 The base unit supports the typing unit, drive motor, intermediate gear
assembly, and keyboard reset mechanism. The base, with components, is supported
by rubber vibration mounts attached to a pan which is part of the cover
assembly. The rubber shock mounts isolate vibrations originating in the typing
unit, gears, and motor from the cover and table. The typing unit drives the
keyboard reset mechanism through a coupler, refer to Figure 2. A plastic shock
disc is used between the mating coupler to reduce noise and vibrations.

### Main Shaft

2.07 The main shaft (Figure 7) is located in the lower rear portion of the
typing unit and extends the full length of the unit. It is supported by ball
bearings mounted in each side frame. The main shaft includes six clutches, each
when tripped, drives its associated mechanism. Each clutch has two shoes which
bear against the inside surface of a drum when the clutch is engaged. The clutch
and drums are mounted to the main shaft by means of a mounting screw. Two of the
clutches (namely the line feed and the spacing clutches) have six sets of lugs
equally spaced about their periphery for controlling the engagement and
disengagement of the clutch shoes with the drum. Thus, these clutches will turn
only one-sixth of a revolution when tripped, except when the single-double line
feed lever is set for double line feed in which case the line feed clutch will
turn one-third of a revolution. The remaining clutches have two sets of lugs and
will turn half of a complete revolution when tripped.

2.08 The six clutches (Figures 8 and 10) on the main shaft are, from right to
left, selector clutch, codebar clutch, print hammer clutch, spacing clutch,
function clutch, and line feed clutch. The selector clutch provides power for
operating the selector, and also trips the codebar clutch and resets the
retraction mechanism.

(Right Front View)

Figure 8 - Selector Cam and Clutch

The codebar clutch drives the codebar positioning mechanism, trips the function
clutch and print hammer clutch. The print hammer clutch drives the print hammer,
ribbon feed, ribbon positioning, dampener detent arms and trips the spacing
clutch. The spacing clutch drives the spacing mechanism. The function clutch
drives the function bar reset bail and the function pawl stripper blade. The
line feed clutch drives the line feed mechanism.

### WIDE PLATEN

2.09 The basic description and operation for the 132 character position wide
platen typing unit (Figures 11 and 12) is similar to the standard typing unit.
This unit contains all the features presently available on the standard platen
sprocket feed unit. The wide platen unit differs from the standard unit for
horizontal tabulation, horizontal tab stop control and the backspace mechanisms.
The right side frame has been moved out for the additional width. An
intermediate casting acts as an auxiliary side frame and provides mounting
facilities for the function box, trip shaft and main shaft extensions. The front
plate, cable assembly, spacing drum and pulley assemblies have been changed. The
spacing drum differs from the standard unit; it contains the carriage return
spring and spacing ratchet. For detailed information on the spacing drum and
cable assembly, refer to Section 574-320-705 on disassembly and reassembly.

### CONTROL FUNCTIONS

2.10 Additional time is required by the typing unit to perform certain machine
control functions. Delete (DEL) characters are used as fill characters in tapes
transmitted and received by the typing unit to provide this additional time;
these fill characters are listed in the following table.

TABLE

<u>DELETE FILL CHARACTERS FOR CONTROL FUNCTIONS</u>

| FUNCTIONS                 | STD UNITS | WIDE PLATEN |

| Vertical Tab              | 0         | 2           |
| Horizontal Tab            | 0         | 2           |

<u>Note</u>: Any function that uses a transmitter stop control, requires two
deletes after the control function.

## 3. TECHNICAL DATA

**Signal Input Data**

3.01 The typing unit is capable of printing symbols for all 128 ASCII
characters. Normally, however, it will be arranged to print the 94 graphic,
numeric, and alpha characters.

**Power Input Data**

3.02 Mechanical power is supplied to the printer mechanism by an electric motor
operating at 3600 rpm. An intermediate gear unit is used to reduce this speed,
and to provide a choice of printer main shaft speeds. Operating speeds
considerably lower than 600 operations per minute (100 wpm) may require changes
in the selector cam assembly.

| Unit Code | Levels | Bauds | OPM | Main Shaft Speed |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | --- | ---------------- |
| 10.00     | 8      | 150   | 900 | 500 RPM          |
| 11.00     | 8      | 110   | 600 | 343 RPM          |

**Output Data**

3.03 The standard friction feed typing unit prints the message on a roll of
single or multiple copy paper of 8-1/2 inches maximum width, 5 inches maximum
diameter.

3.04 The standard sprocket feed unit prints the message on up to six copies of
fan-folded form-feed paper with margin perforations spaced to fit the sprocket
teeth on the typing unit platen. Platens are available for the following paper
widths: 3-5/8, 4, 4-1/4, 4-5/16, 4-1/2, 5, 5-1/2, 5-3/4, 6, 6-1/4, 6-3/8, 6-1/2,
7, 7-1/2, 8, 8-1/2, 9, and 9-1/2 inches with the distance between holes being
one-half inch less than the paper width.

**Size and Weight**

3.05 Overall dimensions of the standard typing unit exclusive of the base unit
are:

- Length: 15-3/4 inches
- Height: 9-5/8 inches
- Depth: 10-7/8 inches

**Temperature Ranges**

3.06 This equipment is intended to be operated in a room environment within the
temperature range of 40°F to 110°F. Serious damage to it could result if this
range is exceeded. In this connection, particular caution should be exercised in
using acoustical or other enclosures.

- (a) The typing unit is designed to operate with standard lubrication without
  damage in an ambient temperature between 40 degrees and 140 degrees F measured
  inside the closed cover.
- (b) Operation at temperatures down to -20 degrees F is possible with special
  lubrication.

**Operational Requirements**

3.07 The unit operates in an environment ranging from 1 percent to 90 percent
relative humidity.

- (a) Operation is not adversely affected by inclination of up to 45 degrees.
  The timing of the machine makes possible the suppression of printing and
  spacing in the same cycle in which a nonprinting code is read by the function
  box.
- (b) Noise and vibration has been kept to a minimum. Noise and vibration
  isolation is provided in the base mounting, cover, and the cabinet.
- (c) No readily combustible material is used in the construction of the unit.

**Wide Platen Units**

3.08 Wide platen sprocket feed typing units have the same technical requirements
as the standard units except for the following physical requirements. Wide
platen units use a 14-7/8 inch form; the difference between the holes being
one-half inch less than the paper width. The basic wide platen typing unit
weighs approximately 36 pounds. The overall dimensions are:

- Length: 21-5/8 inches
- Height: 9-5/8 inches
- Depth: 10-7/8 inches
- Characters Per Line:
  - 132 characters - 10 per inch
  - 158 characters - 12 per inch
- Wire Rope:
  - Uses one rope 124-1/4 inches long.

## 4. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION

### A. Selector Mechanism

4.01 The selector mechanism (Figures 2 and 5) consists of the magnet coils and
armature, a selector cam and clutch, and associated levers, arms and bails
necessary to convert the electrical intervals of the start-stop code to the
mechanical motions which are transferred to the codebar positioning mechanism.

**Manual Coding and Operation**

4.02 Manual coding and operation provides a visual check of the various
mechanisms under conditions that are similar to a. unit under power. Before the
unit can be coded and operated manually, the following set up procedures are
required.

<u>CAUTION:</u> IF THE TYPING UNIT IS MOUNTED IN A SET, DISCONNECT ALL
ELECTRICAL POWER TO THE SET AND REMOVE THE TYPING UNIT FROM ITS BASE.

- (a) Tie back the reset slide on the retraction mechanism as shown in Figure
  13. This procedure prevents the retraction mechanism from moving the no. 5, 6,
  and 7 codebars to a spacing condition and does not allow the typebox to move
  to its retracted position (a desirable condition when checking print hammer
  operation).

Figure 13 - Typing Unit

*Page 13:*

- (b) Attach a selector armature clip (TP321071) to the back of the selector
  mechanism. The installation is performed by inserting the curved end of the
  armature clip between the armature stop bracket and the armature; the other
  end is placed under the lubricator assembly, refer to Figure 14. The armature
  clip holds the selector armature in the attracted (marking) position. When the
  armature is attracted, the push levers for the eight code levels will move to
  a marking condition when the unit is manually operated through one cycle. This
  allows a character code to be manually placed into the selector by lifting off
  the push lever from the selector lever for the spacing bits in the code.
- (c) Install a handwheel (TP161430) with handwheel grip (TP340235) to the
  clutch drum of the selector, refer to Figure 15. The handwheel provides the
  leverage to manually rotate the main shaft.
- (d) Rotate the main shaft counterclockwise until the selector clutch is
  disengaged. Momentarily move the lift lever (Figure 14) down to simulate a
  start pulse and again, rotate the main shaft until all push levers are marking
  and the selector clutch is disengaged. This action clears the selector of any
  previous code and positions the push levers to a marking condition.
- (e) Manually rotate the main shaft in a counterclockwise direction until all
  the clutches are brought to a disengaged position (turning the handwheel with
  a fast spin should latch all the clutches).
- (f) Check to insure that all clutches are fully latched; the main shaft should
  rotate freely without drag. If the clutches are not fully disengaged, use the
  procedure described in the Note in 4.11.

4.03 To manually code and operate a typing unit proceed as follows:

- (a) Determine the spacing bits of the code to be selected from the code chart
  (Figure 16).
- (b) Set the push levers that are to be spacing (spacing bits of the desired
  code) by using a spring hook to push back and release the push lever at the
  point where the spring is hooked, refer to Figure 17. This procedure moves the
  push lever forward which lifts off the push lever from the selector lever and
  causes the code level to go spacing (there is no change in the transfer levers
  at this time).

- HANDWHEEL WITH RUBBER GRIP

Figure 15 - Selector With Handwheel

- (c) Push back the intermediate arm latch bail by moving the auxiliary reset
  lever in the same manner as described in coding the push levers, refer to
  Figure 17. This procedure sets up the transfer mechanism for the code selected
  and positions the codebar shiftbars.
- (d) Pull back and hold the codebar clutch trip lever (Figure 18) and start
  turning the handwheel in a counterclockwise direction, then release the trip
  lever.
- (e) Continue turning the main shaft until the character is printed or function
  is performed.
- (f) To repeat the operation of a previously selected character or function,
  lift the appropriate clutch trip lever on the back of the unit (Figure 18).
  For example, if the character "A" has been coded into the selector and
  printed, and it is desired to repeat the printing operation, lift the printing
  clutch trip lever and turn the main shaft through one cycle and the character
  will print again. This method is used to check printing density or print
  hammer alignment with the type pallets. The same principle applies to a
  function coded into the selector. If a repeat is desired lift the function
  clutch trip lever and turn the main shaft.
- (g) To clear the selector of a previous code, push down the selector clutch
  lift lever and rotate the main shaft through one cycle, refer to 4.02 (d),
  (e), and (f).

4.04 The selector clutch and cam sleeve assembly is comprised of the two-stop
clutch, the start bail and lift lever cam, the eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth and
fourth selector lever cams, the cam for the spacing and marking locklevers, the
third, second, and the first selector lever cams, push lever reset bail cam, and
codebar clutch trip cam. Refer to Figures 17 through 21.

<u>Note</u>: On 5- and 6-level cam sleeves, no cams appear in the 6, 7, and 8th
or 7 and 8th positions respectively.

4.05 During the time in which a closed line circuit (marking) condition exists,
the selector magnet coils are energized and hold the selector armature against
the selector magnet pole pieces. In this stop position, the selector armature
blocks the start lever.

4.06 At the start of a signal for any character or function, the start (spacing)
interval releases the selector armature which under tension of its spring, moves
away from the magnet pole piece and thus, unblocks the start lever. The start
lever turns clockwise under the tension of its spring to move the start bail
into the indent of its cam.

4.07 As the start bail rotates about its pivot point, the attached stop arm is
moved out of engagement with the clutch shoe lever. The selector cam clutch
engages and begins to rotate. By this time, the start lever tip has moved into
the selector armature extension cut-out and the armature starts moving in
correspondence with the signal bits. Between the second and third signal bit,
the lift lever is pivoted clockwise by the start bail cam and lifts the start
lever above the armature extension. At this same time, the start bail rides to
the high point of its cam where it remains to hold the start lever away from the
selector armature until late in the character cycle. In approximately the middle
of the cycle the lift lever rides down its cam, thus, lowering the start lever.
When the stop impulse at the end of the signal is received, the selector
armature is pulled up to block the start lever. Thus, the start bail is
prevented from dropping into the low part of its cam (stop position of cam
sleeve, and the attached stop arm is held so as to stop the clutch shoe lever).

4.08 The selector cam clutch disc upon which the latchlever rides has an indent
at each of its two stop positions. When the clutch shoe lever strikes the stop
arm, the inertia of the cam disc assembly causes it to continue to turn until
its lug makes contact with the lug on the clutch shoe lever. At this point, the
latchlever drops into the indent in the cam disc, and the clutch is held
disengaged until the next start interval is received.

4.09 The series of up to eight selecting levers and the marking and spacing
locklevers ride their respective cams on the selector clutch and cam sleeve
assembly. As the marking and spacing signal intervals are applied to the
selector magnet, the selector cam sleeve rotates and actuates the selector
levers. When a spacing interval is received, the marking locklever is blocked by
the end of the armature and the spacing locklever swings toward the right above
the armature and locks it in the spacing position until the next signal
transition is due. Extensions on the marking locklever prevent the selector
levers from following their cams. When a marking impulse of the signal is
received, the spacing locklever is blocked by the end of the armature and the
marking locklever swings to the right below the armature to lock it in the
marking position until the next signal transition is due. During this marking
condition the selector levers are not blocked by the marking locklever
extensions, but are permitted to move against their respective cams. The
selecting lever that is opposite the indent in its cam, while the armature
maintains a marking condition, pivots to the right or selected position
momentarily. Each selecting lever has an associated push lever which drops off a
shelf on the top of the selecting lever when it rides into its cam indent. As
the cam sleeve turns, each selecting lever together with its latched push lever
is moved toward the left and held there until all eight code intervals have been
received. After all the selected push levers have been positioned to the left
and all unselected push levers have been positioned to the right, they are held
until the next start interval is received. When the subsequent start interval
again causes the cam sleeve to rotate, the push lever reset bail, in following
its cam, unlatches the selected push levers. The push levers then return to the
unselected (right) position under their spring tension.

4.10 The no, 1 push lever differs in that it uses an auxiliary no. 1 push lever
and auxiliary reset lever. When the no. 1 selector lever is permitted to follow
its cam (marking condition) the auxiliary no. 1 push lever is selected in the
same manner as other push levers. At this time the strip bail is on the high
part of its cam, resetting all the selected push levers above the shelves on
their associated selector levers. When the no. 1 selector lever returns
counterclockwise to the intermediate position on the cam, a tab on the auxiliary
no. 1 push lever engages the no. 1 push lever and drives it to the left in a
marking condition. At approximately midcycle the auxiliary push lever is
stripped by its auxiliary strip bail, thus, the auxiliary no. 1 push lever is
prepared for the next incoming marking pulse. The auxiliary lever action permits
normal strip operation to occur between no. 1 and no. 2 pulse selection.

4.11 The selector cam sleeve clutch has two stop positions and likewise the
individual cams have two complete identical contours in 360 degrees, providing
for two complete cycles of operation for each revolution of the cam sleeve.

*Page 17:*

<u>Note:</u> When rotating the main shaft by hand, the clutches will not fully
disengage upon reaching the stop position. In order to relieve the drag on the
clutch and permit the main shaft to rotate freely, apply pressure on the lug of
the clutch disc to cause it to engage its latchlever. This procedure should be
followed prior to applying power to the unit.

#### Start-Stop Operation (Figure 19)

4.12 Engage-disengage selector cam sleeve with main shaft; responds to start and
stop bits of a character.

Operation

Engage selector cam sleeve with main shaft.
- (1) Start (spacing) bit of new character deenergizes selector magnets and
  releases armature.
- (2) Armature, under tension of armature spring, falls against downstop
  bracket.
- (3) Absence of armature extension unlatches start lever which, under tension
  of start lever spring, pivots inward moving the stop arm bail into the indent
  of its cam. As the stop arm bail pivots inward, the attached stop arm pivots
  out of path of clutch shoe lever.
- (4) Clutch shoe levers expand to engage disc and cam sleeve assembly with
 rotating clutch drum.

Raise, reset, and lower start lever. Block clutch shoe lever.
- (1) Cam sleeve starts rotating. Selector cam sleeve mechanically operates its
  cam followers in a prearranged sequence as code level signals (marking or
  spacing) operate the armature (4.14).
- (2) Between the second and third character bit, lift lever elevates start
  lever above opening in armature extension. Stop arm bail rides to high part of
  stop arm cam forcing start lever away from armature, restoring stop arm to
  blocking position.

Disengage selector cam sleeve from main shaft.
- (1) Lift lever falls into indent of stop arm cam and lowers start lever.
- (2) Stop (marking) bit at end of character energizes selector magnets and
  attracts armature.
- (3) Stop arm cam presents indent to stop arm bail.
- (4) Stop arm bail begins to enter indent, but is prevented from entering fully
  by start lever whose inward movement is blocked by armature extension. Stop
  arm engages shoe lever to disengage cam sleeve from rotating clutch drum.

#### Push Lever Reset (Figure 20)

4.13 Strip the previous character from push levers after a start bit causes the
selector cam sleeve to engage the main shaft.

Operation

As cam sleeve begins rotating, high part of push lever reset bail cam lifts push
lever reset bail against tension of spring. Bail pivots, lifting and unlatching
the marking push levers from in front of their selector levers. The bail returns
to the unoperated position when the lobe drops from the high part of the cam.
All of the push levers, except the auxiliary push lever (4.15) will then be in
the spacing condition.

#### Selection (Figure 21)

4.14 Code selections are performed by sequentially positioning push levers as
marking and spacing intervals are applied to selector magnets.

Operation

View (A) - Idle Condition
- (1) Selector cam sleeve shown before starting selection cycle. Marking
  locklever, spacing locklever, and eight selector levers held against cam
  sleeve by their individual springs; the lobes of each lever are riding on high
  part of selector cam sleeve.
- (2) As marking and spacing signal intervals are applied to selector magnets,
  selector cam sleeve rotates and actuates selector levers.

*Page 19:*

<u>Note</u>: The range finder selects the most favorable period for sampling
character bits as received by the selector magnets. The range finder clamp arm,
when pivoted clockwise, permits the range finder scale adjustment. Turning the
range finder scale, mechanically adjusts the position of the stop arm, stop arm
bail, lift lever, and cam sleeve.

View (B) - Marking Condition
- (1) When marking impulse is received, the spacing locklever is blocked by end
  of armature extension. Top of marking locklever moves under armature
  extension, supporting armature in marking position until next signal
  transition is due.
- (2) During marking condition, selector levers are not blocked by marking
  locklever extensions, but are permitted to ride against their respective cams,
  Only that selector lever which is opposite the indent in its can affect its
  push lever,
- (3) As the lobe of the selector lever is drawn into its cam indent, the push
  lever drops off the shelf of its selector lever. When the selector lever is
  forced out of its indent, the selected push lever slides to the marking
  position.

View (C) - Spacing Condition
- (1) When spacing interval is received, the marking locklever is blocked by end
  of armature extension. Spacing locklever swings above armature extension and
  locks it in the spacing position until next signal transition is due.
- (2) During spacing condition, selector levers are prevented from riding their
  respective cams by extensions on marking locklever.
- (3) Lobe of selector lever opposite its cam indent cannot enter indent fully.
  Push lever will not latch behind selector lever, but will remain on shelf.

#### Auxiliary Push Lever (Figure 22)

4.15 Auxiliary push levers sense marking or spacing position of selector lever
no. 1. Normal strip operation (push lever reset) occurs during reception of code
bit no. 1 and does not permit push lever no. 1 to sense position of its selector
lever.

Operation

Auxiliary push lever responds to marking impulse for push lever no. 1. When bit
no. 1 is marking, auxiliary push lever drops behind shoulder of selector lever
as push lever no. 1 is stripped. Tab on auxiliary push lever carries push lever
no. 1 to marking position. When push lever reset bail (4.13) returns to
unoperated position, push lever no. 1 is behind, but not touching, its selector
lever. Approximately half way through selection cycle, auxiliary push lever is
stripped by auxiliary reset lever (4.16). Push lever no. 1 is then latched by
selector lever no. 1.

4.16 The conditions for the trip and reset mechanism are to strip the count on
typebox retraction mechanism; reset auxiliary push lever and intermediate arm
latch bail, and trip codebar clutch.

#### Trip Cam and Reset Mechanism (Figure 23)

4.17 The codebar clutch trip cam conditions the trip and reset mechanism to
strip the count on typebox retraction mechanism; reset auxiliary push lever and
intermediate arm latch bail, and trip codebar clutch.

Operation

As cam sleeve rotates, high part of cam ope rates retraction reset lever.
Approximately midcycle, second high part of cam operates auxiliary reset lever.
Tab on auxiliary reset lever strips auxiliary push lever, and pawl resets
intermediate arm latch bail in transfer mechanism (4.18). About the same time,
first high part of codebar clutch trip cam operates codebar clutch trip lever to
initiate operation of codebar shift mechanism (4.19).

Figure 24 - Transfer Mechanism

4.18 The coded input from the selector levers are conveyed to the codebar shift
mechanism through the transfer mechanism (Figure 1) by the selected positions of
the push levers to the transfer levers that set up the codebar shiftbars.

Operation

Code Bit Marking
- (1) Push lever latches in front of selector lever. As selector lever and push
  lever move toward front, push lever engages intermediate arm.
- (2) Intermediate arm and transfer lever assembly pivots, causing transfer
  lever to push codebar shiftbar toward rear. Extension on intermediate arm
  latches on top of intermediate arm latch bail.

Code Bit Spacing
- (1) Push lever remains on shoulder of selector lever. No action is transferred
  to intermediate arm.
- (1) Intermediate arm and transfer lever assembly remains unselected, extension
  on intermediate arm remains under latch bail, and codebar shiftbar is held
  toward front.

Strip Intermediate Arms
- (1) Intermediate arm latch bail is operated by auxiliary reset lever (4.16) at
  approximately midcycle.
- (2) Previously marking transfer levers return spacing if their respective push
  levers are now spacing.
