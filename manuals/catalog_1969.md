## introduction and catalog use

This catalog describes Teletype Model 37 equipment for transmitting data over
switched network services available through telephone and telegraph companies.
These terminals can be used for general data communications as well as for
computer input/output. The application of the Model 37 terminal to the switched
network requires a data set or data access arrangements provided by the common
carriers.

Each particular set (e.g., the Model 37/300 automatic send-receive set) is
available in five arrangements with options for each arrangement. These include
table variations, paper handling, and tape handling facilities.

A catalog number with each set arrangement in combination with each option
allows easy ordering of a complete terminal.

Catalog numbers for Model 37/300 automatic send-receive sets include a punch and
reader module. However, if, initially an application requires use of a keyboard
send-receive set (KSR) for conversion to an ASR in the future, the ASR set can
be ordered less the punch and reader module: For example:

- Catalog No. 37/302-1A ASR set complete.
- Catalog No. 37/302-1AX ASR set without the punch and reader module.
- The resulting catalog number, 37/300-1AX, is the KSR required as denoted by
  the “X” following the number.

## Brief Description

Terminals described in this catalog are normally utilized for point-to-point
data communications, or, as computer input/output terminals. Maximum data
transfer rate is 150 words per minute.

The family of terminals in this catalog includes the following terminal
configurations:

**Model 37/100 \
Receive-only sets (RO)**

These sets provide for receiving printed page copy only. They do not have
transmitting capabilities except when equipped with a station identification
generator (answer-back mechanism).

**Model 37/200 \
Keyboard send-receive sets (KSR)**

Model 37/200 terminals are keyboard-equipped for sending to other terminals or
computers. Outgoing data is typed on the page printer for visual checking. The
terminal can also be arranged for full-duplex operation which allows
simultaneous sending and receiving.

**Model 37/300 \
Automatic send-receive set (ASR)**

Model 37/300 terminals are a combination of an appropriate KSR set and a punch
and reader module.

This configuration is the complete terminal. It has the capabilities of the RO
and KSR sets in addition to providing off-line and on-line tape reading and
punching. Tape handling also can be included in the punch and reader module
cabinet for operator convenience. This gives you maximum data handling
capabilities from a single terminal.

## General Characteristics

**Speed and Signal:** Model 37 terminals operate at 150 words per minute (15
characters per second) at a 150 baud transmission rate. The sets utilize a
serial input/output 10 unit code signal consisting of a start bit, seven
information bits, an even parity bit, and a stop bit. Each bit is 6.67
milliseconds in duration.

**Code:** Model 37 handles the USAS X-3.4 ASCII Code and prints the 94 graphics
of this code with letters in both upper and lower case. Adding a Shift-Out
feature allows printing either 16 or 32 additional graphics.

**Printing:** The standard terminal uses a 6-row removable typebox with
provisions for 96 type pallet positions. When a Shift-Out feature is included,
the 6-row typebox is replaced with a 7-row typebox allowing 112 type pallet
positions, or it can be replaced with an 8-row typebox allowing 128 type pallet
positions.

**THIS IS A SAMPLE OF A MODEL 37 PRINTOUT.**

Model 37 prints standard numerals, symbols, and upper and lower case letters. In
<u>two-colors</u>, if desired.

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    1234567890!"#$%&'()<{ =_}~
    |\^]-[>@`+:*:,.?/

The following will demonstrate the use of reverse line space, half reverse line
space, line space, and half line space. With these features we may print
mathematical expressions:

(a + b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>

\[EXAMPLE]

These features also permit us to print chemical expressions:

O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O+4e=4OH

Utilizing half forward and reverse line space, graphs also can be readily
constructed.

FLUOROMETHOLONE

Among the latest features to be made available in the Teletype Model 37 is
on-line tab setting for both vertical and horizontal tabulation.

Lets look first at Horizontal Tabulation:

1. We clear all tabs:
2. Set the tab-stops as required:
3. Transmit the message:

\[EXAMPLE]

(reduced size)

To change the format, we again clear and reset the tab-stops:

\[EXAMPLE]

(reduced size)

Vertical tab setting is accomplished using the above procedure except that
Form-Feed is required to locate the beginning of the form prior to vertical tab
clear.

**Interface:** Model 37 terminal interface**meets requirements of Electronics
Industries Association Standard RS-232-B. No coupling device is required between
the Model 37 terminal and any compatible data set or equivalent unit. This
simplifies installation and maintenance of the terminal.

*See pages 15, 18, 21, and 24 for arrangements.

**For more information see Supplementary Technical Data on pages 26 and 27.

## Control Panel

**Control Panel**

Depending on the set configuration, the control panel can contain 6, 12, or 18
combination keys and/or lamps. The following is a description of each individual
key and lamp combination available for Model 37 terminals. However, to determine
the combination of key and/or lamps for a particular terminal, review the
appropriate terminal description chart in this catalog. (Note: The particular
key feature follows the actual key designation.)

**RECEIVE-ONLY TERMINALS (RO)**

**LOCAL RETURN - PAPER ADVANCE**

**Local Return and Paper Advance Keys.** These keys initiate mechanical actions
for local paper advance and carriage return. With the set’s motor on and Paper
Advance key depressed, the paper continuously advances until key is released.
With the motor on or off, depressing the Local Return key will provide a single
carriage return. Neither operation affects the signal line.

**INTRPT**

**Interrupt Key.** This key, when depressed, initiates a 380 to 690 millisecond
spacing pulse. The pulse, when recognized by a distant transmitting station, can
stop transmission from a keyboard, reader, or other transmitting device as would
be required if some abnormal operating condition existed (i.e., paper or tape
jams or tears).

**HERE-IS**

*Here-Is Key.* The answer-back mechanism is associated with this key. Depressing
the key initiates transmission of a station identification code (or other
information as coded) to a distant terminal.

**OUT-OF-SERVICE**

**Out-of-Service Key and Lamp.** This key, when momentarily depressed,
conditions the “out-of-service” feature that prevents the terminal from
responding to an incoming call. This feature normally is used to allow the
replenishment of paper, ribbons, etc. The associated lamp is “on” when the
“out-of-service” condition exists. It’s restored to normal when key is depressed
and lamp extinguished.

**ERROR**

**Error Key and Lamp.** When the terminal is equipped with vertical parity
detection, this lamp indicates an error condition by lighting upon receipt of a
parity errored character. Depressing the key extinguishes the lamp.

**PTR EOL**

**Printer End-of-Line Lamp.** A lamp is used on the control panel to give visual
indication that the page printer carriage printing position is approaching the
right hand margin. The “end-of-line” indication can be adjusted to take place
anywhere on the page printer platen.

**ALARM**

**Alarm Key and Lamp.** This lamp indicates “paper-out” for pin feed page
printer sets and “low-paper” indication for friction feed sets. If a paper-out”
or “low-paper” condition occurs during transmission, the lamp lights. For
friction and pin feed page printers, upon completing transmission the terminal
won’t respond to further calls until the supply is replenished.

The Alarm lamp is also used in some arrangements to indicate receipt of a
character with incorrect even vertical parity. When an errored character is
received the lamp will light and remain on until the Alarm key is depressed.

**PAPER ALARM**

**Low Paper Alarm Key and Lamp.** This lamp when lighted signifies a “low paper
supply” condition for a friction feed printer or a “paper out” condition for a
pin feed printer. If the alarm was activated by a low or exhausted paper supply
during transmission, the transmission continues until completed. The station
won’t respond to further data service until the paper supply is replenished. At
this time the Alarm lamp is automatically extinguished.

Note: Control panels will not contain a Low Paper Alarm key and lamp or an Error
key and lamp if equipped with the Alarm key and lamp.

**KEYBOARD SEND-RECEIVE TERMINALS (KSR)** can be provided with any of the RO
controls in addition to the following:

**PROCEED**

**Proceed Key and Lamp.** The feature associated with this key and lamp enables
the keyboard to respond or not respond under control of a distant transmitting
terminal or computer. The Proceed lamp will be “on” and the keyboard enabled to
respond, when the terminal EIA interface lead “clear- to-send” is “on” and the
terminal has received the ASCII Control Character Acknowledge (ACK).

The Proceed lamp is extinguished and the keyboard in a condition not to respond
by the loss of “clear to send” or upon receipt of the ASCII control character,
Negative Acknowledge (NAK), or upon receipt of an “interrupt” (break) signal.

After contact with a distant terminal has been made, the keyboard can always be
enabled by depressing the Proceed key, or upon receipt of acknowledge (ACK). If
an “interrupt” signal is received, the keyboard can only be enabled to respond
by depressing the Proceed key.

Note: Control of the keyboard by the ASCII control characters, ACK and NAK not
available on some terminals.

**OFF-LINE**

**Off-Line Key and Lamp.** This key when operated places the set off-line with
the motor running. In this mode, the terminal can be used for maintenance,
training, typing practice or miscellaneous uses. The lamp is lighted when in the
“off-line” mode and is extinguished by depressing the associated key. When the
lamp is “off” the motor is controlled by the state of the EIA interface lead
“data set ready”.

**AUTOMATIC SEND-RECEIVE TERMINALS (ASR)** can be provided with any of the RO or
KSR controls in addition to the following:

**PROCEED**

**Proceed Key and Lamp.** On an ASR set, the feature provides identical control
of the keyboard. It also controls the tape reader.

**READER AUTO**

**Automatic Reader Control Key and Lamp.** When the key is depressed its lamp
lights and the station is conditioned for on- line control of the reader. A
second operation of the key extinguishes its light and disables the on-line
reader control feature. On-line or local control of the reader is affected by
the use of the ASCII control character DC1 for “reader on” and DC3 for “reader
off”. Since these controls are interpreted by mechanisms in the page printer,
the printer and reader must both be either in the on-line or off-line mode.

**KBD EOL**

**Keyboard End-of-Line.** This lamp, used in conjunction with a keyboard
character counter, provides visual indication of “end-of-line” condition when
the page printer isn’t utilized as a monitor. On an automatic send-receive set
(ASR), tape can be prepared without page copy by observing the on/off state of
the lamp to judge the end of a printed line.

**KBD LOCAL**

**Keyboard Local Key and Lamp.** When the key is depressed the lamp lights and
the keyboard is placed in “local off-line” circuit. A second operation of the
key extinguishes its lamp and restores the keyboard to on-line condition.

**PRINTER LOCAL**

**Printer Local Key and Lamp.** When key is depressed the lamp lights and the
printer is placed in “local off-line” circuit. A second depression of the key
extinguishes its lamp and restores the printer to on-line condition.

**PUNCH LOCAL**

**Punch Local Key and Lamp.** When key is depressed the lamp lights and the
punch is placed in “local off-line” circuit. The punch selector may or may not
respond depending upon the state of the Punch On key. Depressing the key again
extinguishes its lamp and restores the punch to “on-line” condition.

**PUNCH ON**

**Punch-On Key and Lamp.** When key is depressed the lamp lights and the punch
will respond for tape preparation. A second depression of the key extinguishes
its lamp and the punch will not respond to additional signals. The punch can be
set not to respond either locally or in the on-line mode by the operator.

**READER LOCAL**

**Reader Local Key and Lamp.** Depressing this key places the reader in “local
off-line” circuit and lights the lamp. Depressing the key again allows the
reader to transmit on-line.

All components of an ASR (e.g., printer, keyboard, punch and reader) are
interoperative in either the “on-line” or “local” modes or combinations thereof.
This depends upon the on or off state of the associated control panel light.
Such flexibility permits various modes of operation including simultaneous data
reception and local tape preparation. In addition, the reader can read a variety
of non-ASCII coded tapes, provided the printer or punch is “on-line”.

## Keyboard

The Model 37 keyboard provides a layout of keys similar to a standard office
typewriter. You can generate the entire 128 ASCII character set with an extra
bit to provide even vertical parity over the eight bits.

A pertinent feature of the keyboard permits you to repeat any character desired
by depressing a key beyond its normal stop. Any key can be made repeatable by a
simple field modification. In the standard arrangement, the ten most commonly
used keys in the shift and unshift states are repeatable. They are as follows:

- Line Space
- Space
- Null
- Backspace
- Delete
- Colon (:) or Asterisk (*)
- Hyphen (-) or Equals (= )
- Shift and Unshift Period (.)
- Shift and Unshift Underscore (_)
- Upper and Lower Case X

The keyboard is also equipped to provide control functions. You simply depress
the Control key and the desired graphic key simultaneously. Most control
character designations require using the Control key. Control designations
appear in black on the distinctive dark grey keytop. In addition, commonly used
controls (such as Horizontal Tabulation, Backspace, Carriage Return and Line
Space) are generated by separate keys not requiring operation with the Control
key. Another feature is the override capability of the control key when the
keyboard is in shift-lock condition. This permits generating control characters
without having to unshift.

The following list shows control characters which the Model 37 can generate:
